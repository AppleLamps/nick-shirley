[Speaker 15]
Convict and remove trying to create a fascist state and I would like to see him remove from office along with the vice-president And Those who are in his cabinet seem to me to be very unqualified for the most part and I Hate the corruption of his administration, which is obvious to any observer, I think and what's your

[Nick Shirley]
least favorite corruption Or what's like something you've seen that's like a lot of corruption from Trump so far.

[Speaker 15]
Well I'd say the fact that he's using crypto to take bribes from my perspective of billions of dollars But beyond that the anti-immigration is in my estimation Entirely out of step with what America is and what it was made to be at its best it is inconsistent with all our ideals And you are saying impeach him and what would they should they impeach him for? For corruption first because that would be the easiest to prove I think and in addition to that He's guilty of so many crimes that it's hard to list them all

[Nick Shirley]
Well, thank you so much for your time, I hope you enjoy this protest Thanks for talking with us you guys see we're just here to have conversation with people and see what they're out here today protesting for All right, everybody here in the chat Thank you crane 802 I want to remind everybody I need your emails So go out and fill out the link in the pin comment above I need your emails because there's some weird stuff happening I want to make sure something ever does happen.

Yeah, it does. Who are you? My name is Nick Shirley.

Yeah, and uh stop Trump. How long did it take you make that sign made in?

[Speaker 34]
2016 Wow, so you're I come from the 20th century. You've been hating on shot.

[Nick Shirley]
I've been doing this for a long time You've been this is just the latest thing you've been hating on Trump for about 10 years now and has your hatred for Trump or You're just liking for Trump just gone up over the past 10 years. It's pinned at 11 You know that oh, it's been at 11 Wow, so, you know, it's past 10 your least favorite thing about Trump His character He's a man with no honor He he lies He's he's despicable What did you think about Trump's meeting with Zoran?

[Speaker 34]
Who are you? My name is Nick Shirley. I know but what why are you doing this?

[Nick Shirley]
Oh, we're just coming out here talking to people about Why are you out here? I'm talking to you. My name is Nick Shirley.

I Worked for Nick Shirley. I think I think maybe you're What's a mole Bye Geez okay. How are you doing, sir?

I'm fine. How about yourself? Good.

What do you think about the Zoran Trump meeting yesterday?

[Speaker 5]
It just kind of all for show, I mean this is sort of this the thing Trump does is come in and You know, I'm the reasonable guy and there's little conversations one-on-one evidently, that's That's his persona, but it's not going to change anything It's not gonna change his approach to anything.

[Nick Shirley]
Were you surprised there? I have a civil discourse and like

[Speaker 5]
no, I mean I was I was pleased but That that's happened before with Trump It's not gonna change anything in terms of his policies or the way that he views

[Nick Shirley]
New York and the way that's going you think it might encourage more Democrats to talk face-to-face with Trump

[Speaker 5]
It's He's the one in control of those opportunities Yes, yes, I would like to see civil discourse, you know, despite the uncivil path that we're on here it's Important that We try to fix what's going on because we're on a We're on a very bad path at this point in time They shouldn't get and people don't one thing people don't seem to realize about history Is that when things start going bad, they can go very bad very fast

[Nick Shirley]
And that's part of my fear and with the Democrats and Republicans right now Who do you think's the face of the Democratic Party right now?

[Speaker 5]
Well, I mean what I would like to see it be it'd be a OC and There needs to mean I am certainly not a young person, but I would like to see a transition in The Way that this the geriatric leadership is holding on is and and and having said that I don't want a plumbers Go look somebody like Bernie Sanders Mine still sharp speaks. Well But there needs to be a progression in in the leadership and Ross the Party's not going to stay intact and it's a two-party system. So so AOC for 2028 Sure, I mean She they true she is there's always been an attempt and back to like with the squad and all of that to put her in A little box of being the the wild radical and but people actually listen to her speak She wants to fix things and she's got good ideas and it's very intelligent.

[Nick Shirley]
She doesn't know how to rally the troops Pardon me. She doesn't know how to rally the troops. She has a very good base on the internet and

[Speaker 5]
Actually the things where Republicans have been willing to talk off the record I think there's a certain respect for her in that she wants to get stuff done and understands there are things that it's okay to compromise on and and she does it and so Yeah, I mean obviously she's not the only one but she's certainly somebody who stands out

[Nick Shirley]
Yeah, and obviously today with this resist the regime protest That's curious what people are more so protest protesting about because just a few weeks ago A lot of the protests were about the Epstein files.

[Speaker 5]
Those are now gonna be released the government shut down that was another topic as well the Epstein files aren't necessarily going to be released the introducing that thing with directing the DOJ to Investigate.

[Nick Shirley]
This is a big one. Let's see flip that up there Hooper Trump just wow How long did that take you to make How long did this take you to make Couple days And you have the Mexican flag the Canadian flag the United States flag in the Ukrainian flag What's your favorite country out of those five America, of course, but we have to support all of these guys I'm not an instigator. I was asking about a sign and then you guys come over and instigate me.

I don't get what your problem is Mr. Yellow vest. I was having a great conversation. Then you just come in and ruin it Maybe that's why you guys can't ever get your point across.

Oh click record. Make sure you hit it record. But uh Yeah, so what brings you out here today, sir?

Says after your thoughts and your prayers your sign says your sticker or what do you call that? Your pin says F your thoughts and your purse let's show it let's let's see this thing look you believe in the power of prayer no Such a happy man right here cold Cold stone face. Have a great rest of your day, sir Hope you do a great job at keeping other people away from speaking to have a conversation with people today.

So Applaud you for your efforts. They're gonna fell but we're gonna keep going. Here we go you got this guy dancing over here with the Macklemore jet Macklemore jacket like from the that's like the jacket from the thrift shop music video.

I We got a lot of people out here this is at the Lincoln Memorial everybody the Lincoln Memorial is right up here You have the hands maids up there. Let's go talk to some of these folks up here And we got this guy's gonna be following us around Looks like we got It seems like people are pretty pissed off about the piggy statement Trump made the other day I want to get some pin Can I get a pin today Can I get one What's your favorite one rage against the regime abolish ice FTD it's alright.

[Speaker 15]
We're just showing These guys are not here for the same reason you're here. You may want to be very careful talking.

[Nick Shirley]
We're here to talk to people Well, thanks for the pin let them eat cake I like them I like the piggy That's pretty good you guys are quick on that Photoshop just like that We got some old ladies dancing around right now uphold the Constitution This is democracy justice for all free speech, this is fascism misogyny and patriarchy and they're just Switching signs. Let's go see what makes them. They're having a joyful day today.

How are you guys doing? Would you guys consider Trump a fascist? What do you guys think about the Mandami meeting yesterday What was that about?

[Speaker 8]
Very curious.

[Nick Shirley]
Are you surprised to see that? They were like, it seems like they were pretty good friends. Actually.

[Speaker 8]
I was a little surprised Very surprised Supposedly it written off as just a couple of boys from Queens, but it was definitely a little unnerving Yeah, do you think it's kind of strange that a Democrat could have a civil conversation and become somewhat enemies on the internet? And then they're able to smile with each other in person in the Oval Office Well, I don't think it's strange to have differences of opinion and still be Civil with one another no. Yeah But I have no trust in at least one of the parties at that meeting Did you lose a little bit of trust in Mandami after seeing him talk so nice about the Trump?

It just makes me wonder What his motivation was for that meeting?

[Nick Shirley]
We'll see time will tell And when he was asked if he thinks Trump's a fascist He's kind of trying to start to explain something and Trump said no don't explain yourself to say yes. It's a lot easier than explaining He knows he's a fascist. What makes you think Trump's a fascist?

[Speaker 8]
His power grab his authoritarianism his hatred Cruelty to anyone that isn't like himself Fascism and democracy.

[Nick Shirley]
Okay. So what are the signs mean? Diversity this is fascism.

[Speaker 8]
That's the main one display and then it goes over to that side This is what democracy looks like. It's the difference. There's a difference So what's the opposite of this is fascism Lawlessness is fascist Diversity inclusion is part of democracy.

It's just kind of pointing out.

[Nick Shirley]
This is like a fun game This is like a card game you play at school Teach me something ma'am media intimidation What's happening and this is democracy repress Propaganda is next. What's up? What what's up to the propaganda?

What's the question? Oh, we're just going through the signs out here. So we got propaganda.

What's the opposite of propaganda for democracy?

[Speaker 3]
It would be truth and transparency Yep, see each one of them that they're not all back-to-back the opposite But all the fascist side has things that this administration is actually done Stealing our data. Yes Right, and these are things that we covet as Americans because We take it for granted up until now and now we're losing it and it's both heart. It's heartbreaking.

Yeah, really and we're We're in a really rough spot Check some bounces. Yeah voter suppression How's our vote getting being suppressed right now Well for one if the gerrymandering is one way they can do it the other way is they're trying to stop like mail-in votes there Do you think melon voting should be a thing?

[Speaker 8]
I think mail-in voting can be yeah I think it's okay for in certain circumstances I think maybe if somebody can't get to the polls, they're disabled, but I don't think it should be an option for everybody mailed in his ballots Trump is a mail-in voter and has been in his past Yeah, how do you know that? Well, I I think it's been fairly well-documented Mel's in his boat. Yeah, then he's in his past.

[Speaker 3]
I mean he was also a Democrat He's an opportunist Isolation isolationism America first, you know the hell with all the other countries. I mean honestly think about what do you America first? I Am humanity first.

I I love people. I love the people in Africa who are no longer getting our AIDS medications and our Supplemental nutrition to their children That's it is good for America to do that and not giving immunizations in another country Guess what? They do come here those those viruses those illnesses We'll just raise here and then the administration is also causing people to be afraid of vaccines Unproven Theories that they have and so the combination is really going to be deadly We haven't seen it yet, but there are high outbreaks of different things in our country first getting marginalized people Pretty straightforward there.

They're rounding up brown people right now. Not all only but mostly And they're they deport people or no They should follow the legal process due process if somebody's here illegally and they don't They don't qualify to be here Then it should be done in a dignified way and they should have their day in court and then go from there And let you guys enjoy the rest guys My name is Nick Shirley.

[Nick Shirley]
We just come out here and talk to people All events for live right now. We just come out I Don't do sub stack. What do you do YouTube YouTube?

[Nick Shirley]
They've really yeah, you think those should be inside schools like it or I don't think they're like banning the books I think they're more so removing them from the school so kids don't have to see and learn about

[Speaker 3]
Well, they actually such a young age Went in and removed them from the Naval Academy College students who can choose to read them or not They're adults So then it took a group of adults in Annapolis to buy them all back and hand them out to people who wanted them but I mean they're wiping out like some of the black history And they've taken out some of the black kids.

I'm just paying attention not paid to be here Wow, you're coming out here looking beautiful. Miss Piggy looking hot What's your favorite how offensive do you think that was when Trump called the lady Piggy?

[Speaker 22]
I thought it was pretty offensive. So we're we're all take the pig back man miss Piggy all the way but you know, holy cow And they had so many times to walk that back as an accident He thought her name was Peggy or whatever, but he just all doubled down Ridiculous.

[Nick Shirley]
Yeah, do you think now Trump whether he knows or not might have started a little figure of biggie a Piggy revolt in the United States My sister and I go did geez it twins out here.

[Speaker 22]
I've never seen two good-looking pigs Did Trump start a Miss Piggy come back or something? And I was like, well as far as we go.

[Speaker 26]
Yeah a revolution a revolution Yes, it's a revolution of piggies. That's exactly right and come back might not be the word you want to use Are we gonna see a lot more woman coming around with some nice little big noses and biggies out walk around you see You know, I believe Caroline Leavitt might be the Miss Piggy Yes, that's who I think I cannot stand her.

[Nick Shirley]
Oh Your sign says don't say Okay Frank and honest with everyone in this room KKK Caroline you are lying To cook. Oh, you know what?

[Speaker 26]
So you guys don't like Caroline, oh just kind of a little bit no, I don't like her at all I mean she is I want a 28 year old who spills lies and No, I I can't stand any of this.

[Nick Shirley]
Can you I What do you guys think about like the current state of the country? I feel like we're doing pretty good I think we're doing a pretty good job like right now as far as like bring him back and what Trump voted for I Ain't rage-bained anybody.

[Speaker 22]
We're just having a good time He's not bringing back anything. He's bringing back hatred division.

[Nick Shirley]
Yeah, you can't bring people back together with fear Yeah, and that's what he's like in the second term a lot like the cast has been from like the deportations That's been like one of the big topics is deportations. We obviously have the longest government shutdown in the history of the United States I thought that was pretty crazy And Epstein files, I think that was a mess-up by Trump by originally not releasing them I think they should really stem from the get-go. I think that's like why you saw Maggie get pretty upset Did you just throw trash on the ground?

[Speaker 22]
I I'm not treating our capital like that and I can't stand the president, right?

[Nick Shirley]
You need to pick that up. All right. Yeah so much.

Yeah, and I I do like the costumes. Yeah, god bless you guys How are you doing? Good I'll go one Okay, I will I will How are you doing ma'am, what are you dressed up as today I Just a sentinel.

[Nick Shirley]
It's like we're going to Hogwarts out here. Yeah Not me not me The hall is a seat of power How do you feel about this protest aid to resist the regime protest? And how do you feel like you guys can get rid of the regime the Trump regime?

That's a good question You feel like he will be impeached this second term.

[Speaker 14]
I hope so. I'm not convinced that our Representatives are gonna do the right thing But we do have Grounds for impeachment and what do you mean?

[Nick Shirley]
What do you think he can be impeached for?

[Speaker 14]
Well, is the illegal power grabs shutting down the government Lying to us.

[Nick Shirley]
Yeah, who do you think is the blame for the government shutdown? Or was the blame for the government shutdown?

[Speaker 14]
I Couldn't tell you. I think it was the Republicans and Mike Johnson. I think they're plotting to take it over Were you surprised when the Democrats?

Folded and I was angry Surprised No, but I was angry.

[Nick Shirley]
Do you think better means a Republican or a Democrat?

[Speaker 14]
I think he's He's a traitor to his constituency.

[Nick Shirley]
That's what I think He does not and who do you think's the face of the Democrat Party right now?

[Speaker 14]
I Couldn't point to one I look to Bernie Think Zoran too bad Zoran can't be president, huh? I don't know enough about him.

[Nick Shirley]
Yeah Do you think he's the potential future face the Democrat Party Zoran Mandami?

[Speaker 14]
Again, I don't know. I hope one guy said AOC. He hopes AOC becomes president I have more power more more influence.

[Nick Shirley]
You think that'd be a good idea.

[Speaker 14]
I do.

[Nick Shirley]

What's the chicken costume represent?

[Speaker 19]
It's kind of dual First in terms of the conflicts that are going on between the two parties. It kind of takes the temperature down Which we think is important but secondly It makes a statement About what we think in with all your years and wisdom.

[Nick Shirley]
Have you ever seen a president like Donald Trump?

[Speaker 19]
Never never. It's the most dangerous president we've ever had and how is he so dangerous?

[Nick Shirley]
What how much time have you got we got a lot of time Yeah, well not under his reign Simplest terms what makes Trump so dangerous the rule of law Being taken away.

[Speaker 19]
There won't be elections.

[Nick Shirley]
We don't need a dictator You worried he'll become a dictator. Say again. You're worried.

[Speaker 19]
He'll become a dictator given half a chance That's what his staff are working toward.

[Nick Shirley]
Would you like him to run for a third term? Or do you think that's possible?

[Speaker 19]
It's illegal and nothing is beyond his Imagination he'll do anything Awesome.

[Nick Shirley]
Well, I don't want to make you Stand around for too long. Mr. Chicken Keep clucking. It's taco taco.

Have a good day All right, let's move. Look at this. Yeah, we got a ton of people down here on the National Mall right now Look at this Wow, we got lots and lots of people let's go down into the madness Let's go See They got this lady with the tick-tock Mobefa sign Now I'm gonna ask Trump we're gonna go down into the chaos and see what happens Wow, it's a lab on froggy.

Yeah. Yeah. Let's hear it.

[Speaker 4]
Come back Are you not worried about the Second Amendment about An executive order can be written to overturn the First Amendment The next Democratic president can write an executive order and restrict and limit your Second Amendment, right? And that's what I'm worried about is unless it's stopped.

[Nick Shirley]
Do you want to keep your guns?

[Speaker 4]
I want the Constitution to be protected and

[Nick Shirley]
We're on the same side right here we both are protecting the Constitution I just for me

[Speaker 4]
I just you know, there is a way that the Constitution has changed and You know, it's always been the way and I think you know The the burning flags is a very good example of something that's protected by the First Amendment And then went through the Supreme Court was backed up by the Supreme Court and reinforced to be a protected First Amendment, right? And an executive order is you know You can now be arrested for it and that just makes me nervous because they've talked about taking guns away from trans people They've talked about you know Registries and trying to get people to like write down and like Acknowledge that they have them and that's scary. I don't like any of that.

I don't like you know I don't like banking apps on my phone. I like nothing.

[Nick Shirley]
So I'm just very Leave me alone Yeah you would like your ideal world would be like living in the woods and just like Staying away from everybody.

[Speaker 4]
They're going to no protest and just like enjoying life and not worry about the government so I did actually I used to work for the government and then I quit in April of 2017 and went and hung out in the woods for about four years. I was life in the woods delightful So delightful a lot more peaceful than this. Oh so much more peaceful.

[Nick Shirley]
Yeah, probably realized like all this stuff What are you all this stuff? Like maybe doesn't matter as much as we may think no, no, no

[Speaker 4]
So I'm honestly opposite opposite so I'm not gonna be your person And you know, it's so that the hiking I did Appalachian Trail like You know, there's the number of towns that you go through that are just like And like the only thing that they have left is like a couple months in the summer There's like hostels and like hikers come and like bring money to these towns and like I just want you know I want everyone to be built up. I want everyone to be protected. I want everyone to be successful and we're agreeing on no I really really really really think this man needs to go he's destroying us and

[Nick Shirley]
Yeah, yeah I think you think of like when you hear the arguments from like the left and right a lot of stuff you're saying the right also say like we're worried about a second amendment being lost in the Democrats, but then my thing is like

[Speaker 4]
for me When Obama was in like office like loved him voted for him But like if he tried to limit the Second Amendment rights I'd be on the streets and for me the fact that I have like I'm in Carroll County Like I grew up with the Second Amendment rights Like this is your most important thing and like the fact that my neighbors aren't here, too When like this is we're all at risk. We're all at risk. Yeah Defend the Constitution man all enemies foreign and domestic Awesome.

[Nick Shirley]
Well, thank you for your time. We appreciate you and have a great day out here

[Speaker 4]
Thank you

[Nick Shirley]
We're live right now, so Like how do you not I think Trump's been more pro-second amendment than

[Speaker 4]
like the next president like anyone now the the precedent has been set that a President can write an executive order to take away your constitutional rights And that means if a Democrat is elected they can do the same thing back and they no one should be able to do that

[Nick Shirley]
Yes I think the most important thing is whoever our politicians are. They're American first and they uphold the Constitution.

Yes Yes, and so you can't write executive orders that take away constitutional rights Yeah That's a violation stuff like I didn't like when Prince and Pam Bondi said Talk about the hate speech and how like they might get arrested Like you could get arrested. I feel like I was like leaning way too like going too far too quick and then The other thing you're talking about the Second Amendment I haven't heard anything from Trump and them saying they're gonna take away the Second Amendment But then also like the burning of the Google flag Burning of the American flag. It's like yeah, like no one wants them to bring the flag But I guess if they do do it, they are protected to do it Like they should be able to burn it, but please don't burn the American flag Yes, maybe that don't do things but like as I saw a man burn in Portland and he didn't get arrested Like so that's for me is like, you know, yeah God bless you, ma'am.

Have a great day. Enjoy it.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, he can do anything on man has to do anything anywhere else. Yeah, that's the one thing. I would impeach him for and He thinks he's above the law.

He thinks he's a king Excuse me, I'll teach for the first thing is his bone spurs his BS his bullshit He used bone spurs to get out of the war. He used his money bought it bought it by the No senator saying get him out. He's a coward.

That's a Dearborn, Michigan video. It took me Longer time than usually that video posted itself some weird stuff are happening. So go ahead and start the link.

It's in the pin Now someone's singing Try to make a witty sign forgot Trump can't read What is the But her emails are you referring to Hillary's yeah, I got it off of her political action site

[Nick Shirley]
Try to make a witty sign forgot Trump can't read What if I told you Trump can read You don't think Trump can read What makes you think that

[Speaker 18]
You

[Nick Shirley]
Worst of the worst free speech I call bullshit free press guardians of PDFs Let's move over here everybody Got some ladies singing right now And what do you think about this protest out here?

[Speaker 24]
I mean, it's pretty par for the course, you know What does it resist today this is the regime resist the regime Yeah, then a lot of that lately a lot more protests than they were in 2016 to 20 It seems like they're protest movements even getting it might be getting even stronger.

[Nick Shirley]
I mean look how big this people Why do you think these people are ever gonna get like protest fatigue?

[Speaker 24]
I said I thought I thought it was gonna happen, you know, there were hundreds of protests in the first two months But I guess not, you know people are activated they're out here It's a much older crowd than we had previously in the first first Trump administration. So I mean This is what it is, you know for now.

[Nick Shirley]
It's peaceful DC's been peaceful We don't know who this is You've been you were out a lot of protests like the Kenosha protests even I've written a book about what you've seen from the Protests, right? Yep One man's radical ride through America and chaos his book is called riot diet He's seen everything firsthand and nobody actually retired From protests he came out here with me today. His book is riot diet.

You guys want to check it out? I believe it's on Amazon, right? Yep, right And now look how many people we got out here now they're asking for money rage against the machine illegal immigrants or immigrants are not criminals, but the president is Wow, whoa, this is quite the same Wow That's a good sign man Listen Did you think it was pretty offensive I'm gonna call that lady you call her piggy or Peggy you look like one of those

[Speaker 14]
I'm lying troll boys

[Nick Shirley]
Well, I'm not trolling you ma'am. I just asking you a question Can't even take a question Quiet don't you have someone to blow? Can you explain your sign a little bit more no, no, who do you think he's blowing Anybody that comes your mind Somebody might be falling in this river today or not the river whatever whatever you want to call this the pool I Gotta be careful standing right here.

Hater's gonna come in and toss me into the water Hell to terminal liar and chief Tons and tons of signs out here. How are you guys doing? What do you guys think about Trump calling that lady?

Did he call her Peggy or Piggy?

[Speaker 10]
Piggy What do you think about him calling her Piggy, well, it's like super atrocious So yeah, I've seen a lot of signs. I didn't realize that is that big of a deal It was that big of a deal in the media like it got that much attention I think it gets that much attention because We don't believe it. We don't believe women nor do we respect them in the United States?

[Speaker 27]
So I think that's why kind of at the top here you guys feel disrespected Convicted rapist in our White House. How do we not feel degraded or disrespected as women like he's trying to take away your rights Yeah, one of your rights have been taken away so far Well, he's trying to make abortion legal Yeah illegal Roe v.

[Speaker 10]
Wade overturning that Pulling sting from women's studies in regards to top to bottom, but like especially in medical What should the the portions be in the hands of the state or the hands of the federal government I Mean I think that overall it should just be illegal.

[Nick Shirley]
It's health care The women should choose It should be like a level what like for instance after a certain amount of weeks someone shouldn't be Unless the mother's life is that danger. Do you think there should be like a standard choice? Yeah, I don't like I don't like the idea of like a baby being inside someone's stomach then it could have had a life and Then it gets taken away And now the Epstein files should be getting released, what do you expect to see from the Epstein files Expect them to be scrubbed and redacted to be super honest with you.

I'll be pissed at the redacted Yeah, I mean it's already been occurring. Yeah, and if we just believe the survivors You think it was a little bit strange to see Marjorie Taylor Greene go against Trump and kind of flip now She's dropped her campaign. She's not gonna be running again.

[Speaker 10]
I Don't think it's that bizarre and she's a woman in general.

[Nick Shirley]
So And where do you think Maga's out right now do you think Maga's Support is dwindling or do you think it's just kind of the same spot getting better or worse?

[Speaker 10]
I think hatred runs deep and I think that there are a lot of hateful people that are within mega and I don't think anything is going to change the way that They believe or what they're doing or how they're acting

[Nick Shirley]
And everyone's saying we want to impeach Trump impeach remove convict, what do you think I can get him impeached for Like what's something that they could actually take to Congress or to the Senate and get him impeached.

[Speaker 10]
They've tried the first the military against civilians for one and he's a Convicted rapist so like the reality is that he should never have been able to run in the first place See right now they're yelling impeach God bless you guys.

[Nick Shirley]
Yeah, I'm super confused. I thought I was like I came out here I was like what are they gonna be protesting today about and it seems like the biggest thing that they're protesting a lot of people A lot of rage about the protest is about Trump calling the reporter piggy Well, they say a lot of bad things about him his family.

[Speaker 25]
They put him in danger, so you know some words. I mean What's that gonna? Do he I couldn't even see the report.

[Nick Shirley]
I have no idea who's talking to so That is really do say a lot of bad things about Trump from call I've seen people even wish death upon him today a lot of people are calling him a PDF can't say the word on YouTube PDF the cult of predators they call us all predators for Quiet piggy yeah, so you're you think calling him piggy is very offensive. Would you call consider calling him Hitler offensive? Or a Nazi you think that's offensive to us when you call us Nazis And he calls you guys piggy and he has uproar about it You don't think that's offensive to call somebody a Nazi ma'am I Don't think she wants to talk she just want to stand here, and do you think it's not offensive to call people who are Men of that have families and kids to call them predators.

You don't find that offensive ma'am But you guys get really pissed off when he uses the word piggy isn't that true like they call us What do they call us if they call me Nazis they call people predators beyond that I've lost friendships

[Speaker 25]

[Speaker 28]
No, we drove drove two days just for this Wow, that's quite amazing Where are you guys from?

[Speaker 30]
This is a good trouble. We're supposed to be I'm from the Midwest.

[Speaker 28]
We're about to over in your Idaho area Yeah, the freedom loving she said how do you guys feel about the Packers Well, are they doing good this year?

[Nick Shirley]
So I used to like play Matthews Yeah, I had a fat head of play Matthews in my room. I was gonna buzz a big football player And Aaron Rodgers His career's kind of gone Right, right, right. But from Wisconsin, what are the people saying in Wisconsin about what Trump's doing to the United States right now?

[Speaker 7]
Well, there's a lot of people that are really pissed off. Let me tell you We have a lot of people regretting their vote because he did win in Wisconsin, you know Most of my friends probably voted for him. So I would say some people are definitely regretting their votes We have a lot of dairy farmers and they're hurting their workforces You know, he's coming after the people that are our neighbors and our friends that's wrong

[Nick Shirley]
What do you mean by he's coming after your neighbors like I see deportations, oh, yeah

[Speaker 7]
I see something after he's also coming after my neighbors by not like Go with those who that are working hard-working people do rely on stuff. Yeah, you know and They're working they can but you know, we're not New York City where Wisconsin, you know, yeah But you know money salaries aren't what they are in other places.

[Nick Shirley]
So It's a tough one it's really sad really sad he's not about them for instance Orman Domi I thought it was interesting yesterday that Zora Mandami went in the he's like he would be he could be considered I'm one of the most radical Democrats like Socialist Democrats Communists Trump calling communists. He's called Trump the fascist everything like that So I thought it was very interesting that like they had that meeting If I might I myself is expecting Trump's like go after and Ali but instead it was like very like I was like wait What's going on right now? Why are they both smiling and having a good conversation?

Do you think for instance during the shutdown if the Democrat would have came to Trump during that time and spoke to him had a meeting you think they would have been able to have a Conversation found common ground like Trump in the nominated.

[Speaker 28]
I don't think that would have happened. They were they requested it. He denied it Unless we catered to him

[Nick Shirley]
Do you think there should be more Democrats that are willing to like sit down with Trump and like have a conversation versus like

[Speaker 28]
There are plenty, but I think it goes both ways and it can't be your way or the highway

[Nick Shirley]
Well, I thought the government shutdown was pretty crazy that I went on for so long without ever really come

[Speaker 7]
Who do you think at fault for the government shut down? Yes, there's both sides But the majority who runs the house who runs the Senate who runs the White House? Yeah, and they need 60 votes Yeah, they did but they weren't willing to go she at all They knew they needed 60 votes, but they're basically saying we know we need this We know you need to come to the aisle with us and vote with us But we're not gonna do a damn thing about it.

We're just gonna sit here and Do nothing and do their job Pay salary and they were at home my representative of Wisconsin I'm taking my picture My representative of Wisconsin Tom Tiffany and I'm gonna say it piece of shit He's done. No townhouse. I call him.

He sends me bullshit stuff. I'm a constituent He doesn't fuss my vote then he can talk to me

[Nick Shirley]
Yeah, no, I think it was pretty messed up that like people over there in Washington were getting paid Meanwhile people who works with the federal government weren't getting paid and government workers are getting paid Consulting I think it's like shows how like bad some ways the government is in some ways where there these people are gonna get paid But then you're gonna get paid. It's like a lot deal with nearly two months not getting paid So unless they had a safety fund That's the thing they don't care yeah, they have zero empathy for human beings From what I understood the main reason the government shut down went on to was obviously the health care bill and they Extend the Affordable Care Act, and they don't want any money Act okay, they want to extend the subsidies.

[Speaker 7]
Yes, okay, and a lot of people will say oh get rid of this plan Okay, it has its flaws. I have been on the ACA. Okay, I relied on that for Several years I needed it and people don't understand by the way ACA allowed you to have It allowed you to have your child on your health care until they were 26 years old Okay, those are some benefits the ACA that people don't seem to understand and really I'm just gonna If we have money for Argentina, we have money for all kinds of other places How about you use that money to help the people here

[Nick Shirley]
God bless you guys great speaking with you. I'll shake it with the right hand left hand handshakes are kind of weird sometimes My name is Nick surely on YouTube I work myself All really okay, yep, we're going back up top I Move them back up the signal gets a little rough when we get down to where all the people are the hands needs Are you doing handmade? Let's just we're keep talking to people up here because the signal really starts jamming yes All right, yeah, we're making sure we get the stream quality back up gonna be back over here Let's just go talk to some of the refugees fashion people.

[Speaker 11]
They get freaking riled up when I go talk to them And FIFA no rapist will ever tell me what to do This is a boomer first out here How are you guys doing?

[Nick Shirley]
Do you guys come to DC for the protest or to come enjoy the monuments? both All right, the streams going through good for me you guys I Think we should start calling these boomer fast If we live we live to tread on Kings America is not a Christian nation really Jesus condemned the rich Should we not have the rich Jesus said the rich man could go to heaven the same way a camel can pass through the eye of a needle It's a lot harder for rich men to get to heaven. They have to give away their shit they have to be able to Put aside

[Speaker 27]
They have to be humble And hoard their wealth like dragons trying to go to the Sun

[Nick Shirley]
Yeah, no, she does not mean that that is not how that scripture is supposed to be meant Rich people can go to heaven, but it's just a lot harder Jesus is saying Thank you so much god bless you do you think do you think the rich are gonna go to heaven she says no I

[Speaker 12]
Mean it it's all about what you do Not how much money you have and like I agree some of the people do the wrong stuff Trump might be one of them but out here doing this make yourself feel good isn't gonna do anything.

So yeah Not going to heaven.

[Nick Shirley]
It's kind of crazy.

[Speaker 12]
She just said it's harder for the rich to go through because of the pride Is the people that are saying that are the most degenerate people in the world and and they don't have any values they're gonna get Them into heaven either. So who should I listen to who should I listen to? You know the person that's dressed like that dance around like that or someone who actually lives it and believes in that stuff Loud rap music and walks around and acts a fool, but you know, there's people out here who want actual conversations They're not doing this stuff.

So it's it is what it is and they're not wearing, you know Call of Duty masks and we're and carrying batons around either. Those are the worst type of people. Would you like to debate somebody?

That's not my thing. I mean, I didn't come here for this. I came here to run but okay I'll let you guys get back here.
