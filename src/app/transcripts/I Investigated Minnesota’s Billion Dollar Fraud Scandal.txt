[Nick Shirley]
Hello, we'd like to ask where the money's going. What do you guys think about the fraud that's taking place here in Minnesota?

[Speaker 3]
I don't think anybody is enabling fraud to happen. Hold Governor Walz accountable for this. What was this money spent on?

[Speaker 2]
1.26 million.

[Speaker 14]
What was that money spent on? Are there any kids?

[Nick Shirley]
Answer the question. Are there children? There's no children inside this building.

Potentially the largest fraud scandal in U.S. history is taking place in Minnesota as literally billions of dollars have been funneled through Somaliran fraudulent businesses. So much fraud it could actually almost replace the entire GDP of Somalia. These fraudsters have worked hand in hand with the Minnesota government as they enabled billions of dollars to be given to fraudulent businesses underneath welfare purposes.

Some of this money eventually landed in the hands of terrorist groups in Somalia like the Al-Shabaab and others enriched themselves all at the U.S. taxpayer's expense. And in this video we will break down all of the fraud from start to finish from going to the fraudulent businesses and confronting the people who are making millions of dollars from the government. And we will also be confronting the incompetent government leaders who let this fraud happen.

And to make this happen I met up with a man who's been doing his own investigation for years now as he has seen the fraud firsthand. His name is David. Let's get into this and be prepared to be shocked.

How deep is this fraud here inside of Minnesota?

[Speaker 2]
It is far worse than anybody can imagine. You heard it's seven to ten billion and maybe more and now the numbers have been revised and put out there publicly that they think it's more like eight billion. How I got involved is that where my office is here in Minneapolis I'm sort of in the heart of all of this fraud and I would see these child care centers.

I said well there aren't any kids there. It's the middle of the day and all I see are a couple of guys standing out front smoking and then I'd go by another daycare and I'd see the same thing. I said well where do these kids play?

And so I started to go online and look and I said this place is licensed for 80 children. They had zero children every time I went by there. They never had a single child there.

Then I started to see all these transportation companies going around and it was always a Somali driver and I said well that's great. They're out there transportation contributing but they never had a passenger, never ever once. And I said well what is all this transportation?

What are they doing? So then I found out that in Minnesota they have something called non-emergency medical transportation. So this is going to the dentist's office, therapy, whatever it might be and I said well how many of these companies are there?

And the research came back that there are a thousand twenty of them and more than 800 of them are Somali owned. Nobody from the state of Minnesota ever crossed checks to see if any rides were ever actually provided. All they did was write the check.

[Nick Shirley]
So right here we have all this paperwork and how are you getting all this information about the fraud?

[Speaker 2]
A lot of it is through my own research and then I have some contacts at the capitol going back many many years and so the data that I'm getting is 100% accurate coming directly from research done by people at the state capitol.

[Nick Shirley]
All this paperwork right here, what are we looking at?

[Speaker 2]
The areas of fraud that I have numbers for are mostly related to child care. This is massive fraud that is beyond anyone's imagination the scope and so for example there's a child care not far from here in Minneapolis that has two day two child cares listed at the same address and together they're licensed supposedly for 120 children. I have never seen a single child there ever and I've been by that place at least 100 times.

[Nick Shirley]
These Somalians, these groups are setting up these daycares, these child care centers, getting money from the government but there's no kids.

[Speaker 2]
No kids. Never had any of them. They're all fraught with violations and even though they have these violations they're still in operation and they're still getting money.

It's millions of dollars for every one of them every year.

[Nick Shirley]
And who's getting the money and where are they getting the money from?

[Speaker 2]
So we have a thing called CCAP. It's a blend of federal and state money. The bottom line is it's taxpayer money so it's state money and it's federal money and the problem is the people at the state of Minnesota are the ones writing the checks.

This is kind of the maddening thing is you have daycare so you have adult daycare and then you have child care and then you have health care and a lot of these same names keep coming up on all of these different types of businesses and then of course we have the transportation and a lot of those same names appear, a lot of the same addresses. There's one building that has 14 Somali health care companies at the same address. There's another building in St. Paul that has 22 Somali health care businesses at the same address.

[Nick Shirley]
And the government knows about this?

[Speaker 2]
The government knows. They're writing the checks. Yeah, the Democrats over there just writing the checks.

What has happened is that the Somali community is a very closed community. They will not speak to anyone outside the community and talk about what's going on within the community. They vote as a bloc and so when you're a politician you're saying, look I've got 100,000 people in Minnesota that if I do something for the community they're going to vote for me.

And that's what it's all about is getting the votes and then the people here in Minnesota, you hear this term Minnesota nice? I'm so sick of that term. The people here are so afraid of being called a racist or an Islamophobe and they're afraid of their own shadow and I don't understand.

Our future generations are going to have to pay for all this fraud and they just want to bury their heads in the sand and go on and just not worry about it. Tim Walz saying there's organized crime in Minnesota. What did he do about it?

Nothing. You got organized crime? What are you doing?

This is the Minnesota law which mandates that anyone who knows of fraud and is a state employee must report that fraud. It's Minnesota statute 3.971 subdivision 9. Not only that, but Walz is also guilty of misconduct of a public employee.

When I look at the world as a whole and I look at fraud, the Twin Cities is ground zero. The fraud is worse here than anywhere else ever in history. Anywhere.

[Nick Shirley]
We're going to confront these people. We're going to go to these daycare centers. We're going to see what's actually happening.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, so we have to be careful because these people are very violent. They're exceptionally violent.

[Nick Shirley]
Now with all of David's evidence, we headed out to the streets of Minneapolis to see how much fraud we could uncover in one afternoon. Where are we going now?

[Speaker 2]
We're going to a place called Mako Child Care, which actually has another child care registered at the same address called Mini Child Care Center.

[Nick Shirley]
So we should see lots of children if there's a this child care center, especially if there's two.

[Speaker 2]
The two of them combined are licensed for 120.

[Nick Shirley]
And how much money have these child care centers received?

[Speaker 2]
None of those vans have moved in six months. None of them. In 2020, one of them received $1.3 million in 2021. They got $987,000. In 2022, they got $714,000. That's the last I have for that one.

And then the other one, $1.604 million in fiscal year 2025. Fiscal year 2024, they got about $800,000. And in fiscal year 2023, they got $904,059.

This place right here. Yes. We're outside of it.

Well, this is actually two daycares are registered here. One of them is Mako, which you see on this sign. The other one is Mini Child Care Center.

And between the two of these child care centers, they're pulling in about $3 million a year. And there are no children. Every facility you go to, the windows will be blocked out so you can't see in.

There's nobody here. You won't see a single child at any of these facilities.

[Nick Shirley]
There are indeed no windows. All the windows are blacked out right here. All right, let's go in.

And the child care center is locked. Should we ring the doorbell? Try to get in, ring the doorbell.

Nobody showed up. They're open seven days a week at 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. It says here on their sign. Yet there's absolutely nobody here.

And this building here right here has generated millions of dollars. And it seems like business isn't even open right now. It's a weekday.

And if this was a daycare center, it wouldn't just be in some industrialized building. There would be maybe like a playground or something outside.

[Speaker 2]
There's no play area for the kids. So where are the kids? Where's anybody?

How can there be nobody here? And it's like this every single day. I've never seen a single child here in nine years.

I've never seen a single child at this building right there.

[Nick Shirley]
Oh, then now it looks like we already got the Somalis coming. Yeah, they're coming. The word's out.

Hello. Is this your daycare?

[Speaker 2]
No. Could you tell us why there are no children? Have you ever seen children at this child care center?

I'm not sure.

[Nick Shirley]
I don't know. Doesn't know if she's ever seen a child here. All right, let's go to the next location.

And the fraud only gets more from here. Make sure you stay till the very end of this video to see exactly how much fraud we find by the time we are done. And before we go to the next location, I want to show you something super interesting about the flags of Minnesota.

And here in Minnesota, if you take a look at the Minnesota state flag, they recently changed it. And it very much so resembles the flag of Somalia. And really quick, I want to tell you about the sponsor of this video, Opus Clip.

What used to just be an AI clipper has now become the most powerful AI growth tool for creators. Right now, over 10 million creators and businesses have used Opus Clip to help them gain over 60 billion views. I've used Opus and I've even had my friends use it.

And it helped my one friend with nearly just 100 followers get a video up to 30,000 views. And it's super simple to use. All you do is you upload a video or copy a YouTube link and Opus will do the rest.

It'll come out with tons of viral shorts for you then to choose from. And Opus just came out their new AI editor 3.0 that comes with smarter auto framing, better virality scoring and new captions. And I've said it before, but Opus is so simple that even my mom can use it.

[Speaker 10]
And if I can use it, I know you can use it.

[Nick Shirley]
And right now, for you guys watching this video, Opus is going to hook you guys up with a sweet deal. You'll get one week free and three months at 50% off. All I have to do is go to the link in the description of this video or go to the pinned comment down below and use code Nick Shirley.

One week free and three months at 50% off. And now let's get back into the video. Now we're going to the next daycare center.

How much money has this one generated?

[Speaker 2]
This one in fiscal year 2025, $1,042,059 dollars. In fiscal year 2024, $1,059,078 dollars. And in fiscal year 2023, $727,336 dollars.

[Nick Shirley]
This next one is literally one block away. And this one's also generated nearly $3 million in the past three years. Let's see if there's any children.

Let's see if any of the buildings are open. Here we go. All right, we've arrived to ABC Learning Center.

All the windows are blacked out. Let's see if anybody is here. This door is locked.

[Speaker 2]
This facility is licensed for 40 children. Zero children. I've come by this place a hundred times.

I've never seen a child here ever. The only thing I've ever seen is someone standing outside smoking.

[Nick Shirley]
What's crazy about this is that last daycare center is that green building right there. And the other daycare center right now is right here. These buildings should be operating as they're receiving literally millions of dollars.

I knocked on the door and to my surprise, somebody actually answered the door. Hello, can we speak? I would like to check a child in the daycare.

Can I speak to a manager? Where can I get paperwork to file for my son? I wanted to put my son Joey in daycare.

And after a few questions, the lady went silent. Looks like little Joey surely ain't going to daycare here. And now where are we going?

[Speaker 2]
Now we're going to Sweet Angel Child Care.

[Nick Shirley]
We're in the middle of a strip mall here inside of this neighborhood.

[Speaker 2]
In fiscal year 2025, this facility, which has its license for 74 kids, was paid 1.26 million dollars in tax money. And there are no kids and all the facilities are the same way. All of them.

[Nick Shirley]
Let's see if anyone opens. Once again, I try to find a spot for my son Joey and they would not open the door. I want to put my son Joey in daycare because I need a spot to put my son Joey.

Is this your daycare center? I just want to put a child in daycare, but all the daycare centers seem to be closed. No one's opening the doors.

[Speaker 2]
You work here? I was, yeah. What's happening?

Where are the kids? Yeah. Says it's licensed for 74 children.

Right here, state of Minnesota. Where are the kids? They got paid 1.26 million dollars in fiscal year 2025. It says they have a capacity for 74 children.

[Speaker 12]
When, when?

[Speaker 2]
Where are the kids? Right here, state of Minnesota website. You work here and you don't know?

[Speaker 4]
I don't know. I was there before. I don't know what's going on.

Were there any kids when you worked here? Kids there, kids there. How many?

[Speaker 2]
I don't know. You don't know? Yeah.

You worked here, okay, well then you're not of any help.

[Nick Shirley]
Can I put my son in a daycare here? Can I speak to someone?

[Speaker 2]
No, I don't know.

[Nick Shirley]
No? Yeah, I would like to see if I can put my son Joey here.

[Speaker 8]
Who's your son Joey?

[Nick Shirley]
My son Joey. Can I check out daycare center?

[Speaker 8]
No! I'm the owner.

[Nick Shirley]
Do you put your kid here in this daycare? There is one child in there. Yeah, I'd like to know if this is a legit business.

[Speaker 8]
Me, I'm scared of you too. How can I explain everything?

[Nick Shirley]
You're scared of me?

[Speaker 8]
Yeah.

[Nick Shirley]
Why?

[Speaker 8]
Because of your color.

[Nick Shirley]
Because of my color? You said you're scared of me because of my color. Does that make you a racist?

[Speaker 8]
Yeah, no, no, no.

[Nick Shirley]
You said you're scared of me because of my color.

[Speaker 8]
I'm not saying you're a racist.

[Nick Shirley]
You said you're scared of me because of my color. That makes you a racist. So right now, they're all getting mad because he's showing the paperwork of this business, being registered as a business.

74 children, no children. We saw one child when the lady opened up the door.

[Speaker 2]
So now they're all getting mad. What was this money spent on? 1.26 million. What was that money spent on?

[Speaker 8]
There aren't any kids? Well, then why are you talking for the owner if you're telling me to talk to the owner?

[Speaker 2]
Do you have a child here? No. Does anybody?

Where are the 74 kids? Did you lose them? Did you lose these kids?

Do I need to call someone? Do I need to issue an Amber Alert for missing children? Are these children missing?

It's not my business that children are missing. 74 infants and toddlers, preschool.

[Nick Shirley]
The proof's right there. There's no children anywhere. I think we're moving on to the next location.

[Speaker 8]
Have a good day.

[Nick Shirley]
As we continue to show the blatant fraud that was taking place here in Minnesota, Somali started following us around the city. And now we're being followed by the Somalis. This is another daycare center.

Absolutely no signage and there's no footprints in the snow of children playing outside. 5 million dollars.

[Speaker 2]
5.9 million in two years. 5.9 million they received in two years. That facility right there.

[Nick Shirley]
And now we have a group of Somalis telling us in our vehicle right now. From this daycare center, we headed over to the infamous Quality Learning Center, which actually spells Quality Leering Center on the outside of their sign. That's how blatant this fraud is here at this daycare.

So this is Quality Leering Center. I meant to say Quality Learning Center.

[Speaker 13]
Don't open up.

[Nick Shirley]
They said they spelled learning wrong.

[Speaker 13]
Don't open up.

[Nick Shirley]
How do you have ice here, ma'am? I'm literally a YouTuber.

[Speaker 13]
Don't open up.

[Nick Shirley]
Ma'am, what do you think about the fraud that's taking place here in Minnesota?

[Speaker 13]
Don't open up. We have ice.

[Speaker 2]
Ma'am, what do you think about this place being licensed for 99 children?

[Speaker 13]
Don't open up.

[Speaker 2]
And getting 4 million dollars over the last two years?

[Speaker 10]
Don't open up. It's ice.

[Speaker 2]
Go away.

[Speaker 10]
What do you think about that?

[Speaker 2]
Are you in favor of that?

[Speaker 10]
Go away. You're not welcome here.

[Nick Shirley]
Shame on you. Are you in favor of 1.9 million dollars going illegally, fraudulently to this business that has Quality Learning Center, but can't even spell learning right on the door?

[Speaker 10]
Don't open up.

[Nick Shirley]
Ma'am, we are not ice.

[Speaker 10]
I don't care who you are. You don't belong here.

[Nick Shirley]
I belong here just like you belong here.

[Speaker 10]
Don't open up. It's ice.

[Nick Shirley]
You do realize that there's supposed to be 99 children in here at this building, but there's no one here. This is a child daycare center.

[Speaker 2]
99 children. Paid 1.9 million dollars this year in CCAP funding. Do you know where the children are?

Were they kidnapped? They run away? Where are the children?

This is state of Minnesota. Right here.

[Speaker 14]
And who are you?

[Nick Shirley]
My name is Nick Shirley, ma'am.

[Speaker 14]
And who are you with?

[Nick Shirley]
Nick Shirley. Nick Shirley on YouTube.

[Speaker 14]
Yeah, so who are you with here?

[Nick Shirley]
Oh, he's just been doing some research, investigating the fraud that's taking place here in Minnesota.

[Speaker 14]
Yeah, I'm with Nick Shirley.

[Nick Shirley]
This lady, she's calling us ice. We're just trying to put law and order back in the streets of the United States. Get rid of all the fraud.

Have you ever seen children at that daycare center right there? Where? Yeah, it's right there.

You've never seen daycare? I haven't seen anybody here. We're going to educate you on something.

So what do you think about this daycare center? They spelt learning wrong. They've received over 1.9 million dollars this year alone, and they're supposed to have 99 children here. I don't see it. Have you ever seen any children here? None.

Not at all. None.

[Speaker 2]
This year they got 1.9 million. Last year they got 1.5 million of your tax money for 99 children. We just want to know where are the kids.

Right. Where are the children?

[Speaker 6]
I don't see them. I've been here since 2017. I haven't seen anybody like that here.

You've never seen a child here? No. Not at all.

[Nick Shirley]
And so you've never seen a child here for eight years? Nope. Not at all.

And how does that make you feel, knowing that this place is receiving 1.9 million dollars?

[Speaker 6]
Disgusting. I mean, what the hell? They're stealing the money.

That's a federal grant too. That's, you know, if they get caught for that, it's a federal offense. I know I studied law.

[Nick Shirley]
And do you think Tim Walz should go to jail for all the fraud that he's enabled here in his state? That's him doing this?

[Speaker 6]
Heck yeah. He's got to be held accountable for this. I mean, there's no rhyme or reason what's going on here.

It's simple. It's nothing there. It's a parking lot.

[Nick Shirley]
And look, they even spelt learning wrong on their sign for a place that's supposed to be educating children.

[Speaker 6]
That's crazy. I mean, who runs it? Who supposedly runs it?

Somalians. Oh my god. Well, we're...

Yeah, it's just... I've never seen nobody here at all.

[Nick Shirley]
So how long have you been living here?

[Speaker 6]
Since 2017.

[Nick Shirley]
You've never seen a single child walk in that building?

[Speaker 6]
No, not at all.

[Nick Shirley]
So this daycare center is literally just a place to traffic money. $1.9 million just this year alone. And this guy's been living here for eight years and has never seen a single child walk through those doors.

There's no windows either. And the only window they do have, the door, is blacked out. Yep, I see that.

[Speaker 6]
I've never seen anybody go in there.

[Nick Shirley]
Within just a few hours, we nearly approached $20 million in fraud. And we headed over to George Floyd's neighborhood to expose more of the fraud taking place.

[Speaker 2]
This place is called Future Leaders Early Learning Center. And it's licensed for 90 children. And in fiscal year 2025, they received $3.6 million. In fiscal year 2024, they received $3 million. So in two years, they got $6.67 million, claiming they have 90 children every day of the week, five days a week.

[Nick Shirley]
These people are making just about more money than NBA athletes.

[Speaker 2]
And we don't even know if they're paying taxes, but we don't know where this money is going. Terrorism, where is it going? But it's theft.

It's fraud. And the reason I'm involved is I want it to stop. I care about Minnesota.

I'm doing this for the people of Minnesota. I don't make a dime of all this time I've spent on this. I put my life at risk several times, but I'm determined to see this through and to correct what is wrong, what is evil.

[Nick Shirley]
Here at Future Leaders Early Learning Center, this building received $3 million, over $3 million. Hello, how are you? I would like to see if I can bring little Joey, my son little Joey here.

Is there a paperwork or can I check out the daycare? No, why can't I check out the daycare? Okay, but if I can get paperwork or anything to submit my son little Joey to come in here to daycare.

We'd really like to put Joey in this daycare. We've heard great things. No, I would like your business card actually.

Okay, can I speak with somebody? Where are the children at? Are there children here today?

No, no children. Yes. Why are there no children?

[Speaker 3]
They're too affected.

[Nick Shirley]
Would my son little Joey have friends to play with here? No, no, no, no friends for little Joey.

[Speaker 12]
Yes, sorry.

[Nick Shirley]
Dang it. Well, have a great rest of your day. Thank you.

So little Joey would not be accepted to that daycare. Joey's still looking for daycare. And because little Joey couldn't get into a daycare, we went to an autism center as they have been popping up everywhere as a rise of autism has occurred here in Minnesota.

Because of the government funds that they're receiving, I tried to check my son Joey into an autism center. We've been going to a lot of these daycare centers. We're trying to find a spot for our little boy Joey, but we thought maybe we could check him into autism center because none of the daycare centers are open.

Yeah. And how many kids do you guys have at this autism center?

[Speaker 6]
I can't give you a number.

[Nick Shirley]
Like more than five?

[Speaker 6]
Probably.

[Nick Shirley]
So you don't really know. What do you guys think about like the fraud that's been labeled on the autism centers here? What do you guys do think about the fraud or how come the autism centers are popping up?

[Speaker 12]
Are you a news reporter?

[Nick Shirley]
My name is Nick. We're doing a little documentary trying to find little Joey a spot to put himself in one of these centers here because there's...

[Speaker 12]
So why are you asking us about the frauds and stuff like that?

[Nick Shirley]
Because we want to make sure we're going to legit business if we're going to bring our little boy Joey here.

[Speaker 4]
This is not a good spot. But that's a number I can call you. But this is a...

You can't let your guys do this.

[Nick Shirley]
Okay. Thank you. So once again, little Joey, he can't even go to daycare and now they won't even accept him if he has autism.

[Speaker 2]
And again, no kids. Couldn't tell you how many kids they serve.

[Nick Shirley]
After being able to provide no evidence of them actually being an autism center in a place where a child could go, they shut the door and we headed to the next fraudulent daycare center that was just around the corner. We're on to the next location. We're still trying to find little Joey a place to go to get some daycare.

[Speaker 2]
So where we're going now is a place called Super Kids Daycare Center. Interestingly, this daycare center was shut down when it was called Creative Minds Daycare and it had received $2.45 million this fiscal year, 2025. They had this shut down because there were so many violations and they went and they just reopened under a new license and they renamed the center Super Kids Daycare Center LLC.

[Nick Shirley]
So they got shut down and started on the other one. Literally the next day. Creative Minds Daycare, $2.45 million got sent to this daycare center. We have empty parking lot. We do have a bus here. This is different.

We'll see if we see anybody. I knocked on the door. Absolutely nobody was inside and once again, no children could be heard anywhere.

So David, once again, another child daycare center. We have a bus out here. No one's inside.

Licensed for over 50 kids. No children anywhere. But yet millions of dollars every single year.

[Speaker 2]
So the sign says Creative Minds Daycare. They got in so much trouble. They had so many violations that they had to shut down and they reopened the next day under Super Kids Daycare Center.

You see 3801 Portland, 3801 Portland, which is where we are.

[Nick Shirley]
So that's fraud right there alone.

[Speaker 2]
Millions and millions of dollars. And again, the kids are missing. Where are the kids?

[Nick Shirley]
You'd think if they had the same address that whoever's inside or working at the Capitol here inside of Minnesota would just say, Oh, maybe that's a red flag.

[Speaker 2]
They just write the check. Human Services, they got to clean out the whole bunch. They're the ones who enabled this fraud.

How can you not look and say, Wait a minute, these two are registered at the same address.

[Nick Shirley]
On top of all of the child care centers, that's just only a small piece of the fraud. What other fraud are they committing here in Minnesota?

[Speaker 2]
So another major piece of the fraud is the home health care industry. Where we're going now is a building that has 14 Somali-owned home health care companies in the same building.

[Nick Shirley]
14 of the same health care companies in one building?

[Speaker 2]
14 home health care companies with different names in the same building.

[Nick Shirley]
How bad has Tim Walz managed the budget here inside of Minnesota?

[Speaker 2]
So the last biennium, we had an $18 billion surplus. This biennium, we have a $6 billion deficit. That's a $24 billion swing in one biennium.

How in the world can you burn through $24 billion in two years? This is how right here. This is a huge part of it.

[Nick Shirley]
And so would you say a lot of that is fraud that's taking place here in Minnesota?

[Speaker 2]
Absolutely. I would say better than 90% of it is absolute outright fraud.

[Nick Shirley]
And a large percentage of this fraud is from these health care companies that are charging the state millions of dollars while they actually aren't providing anything. In fact, the FBI just did a raid a few days ago on a building similar to the one we are about to enter. Inside of this building, there were 14 of nearly the exact same businesses offering the exact same services.

Right here, you have a list of all of the health care companies. Loads of them right here. We want health care.

Yes, we'd like to speak about getting health care here. Why can't I get health care here? Warning, you are under video surveillance.

No trespassing. Security armed. This is the strangest place I've ever been to get health care.

Just a bunch of different places. Health care here. Health care here.

Another health care company right here. There are three health care companies inside of this building right here in this room of 7C. Now we have another helping hand.

Home care LLC. Another health care company. Present help right here.

We're looking for the best rates of health care here inside this building because we have so many options. Who can we talk about getting the best health care? All right, we will not get any health care here.

David, this is one of the stranger places I've ever been. Literally, health care every door you go to, yet nobody will give you a rate. How much money do you think has been funneled through this building?

[Speaker 2]
Every year, I would say 50 to 60 million at least.

[Nick Shirley]
And finally, we were accepted into one of the daycare centers and they actually took down information to give us a rate. However, when we left, we were then met with the police.

[Speaker 5]
I, uh, we received a complaint that someone mentioned your description. We're in this building harassing the individuals who stay here.

[Nick Shirley]
Oh, we're just seeing, we're checking out the rates for health care. Because there's 14 health care companies inside this building, so. Okay.

[Speaker 11]
That's not what he said. He said there's 14 companies here and he's trying to assume because they're Somali providers that everyone here is fraudulent. So he's here with some kind of like propaganda.

[Speaker 5]
No, we're just checking. This is, this is a, um, area that we're allowed to enforce trespassing ordinance. Is there any other reason that you guys are here?

[Nick Shirley]
Well, we were checking rates. We were checking rates. We asked for rates.

[Speaker 5]
Okay. I'm going to have, if you guys are all good, we're going to step outside.

[Nick Shirley]
All right, let's leave. So, all right, we're getting escorted out right now. The police have arrived.

We were checking out the rates, seeing what was happening inside this building. No one would really speak with us. We did go inside the one daycare center and she actually did give us rates for childcare.

Much respect to that lady. What's the problem officer?

[Speaker 5]
Well, so again, we're, we've been getting reports from, there are now multiple individuals that you guys were harassing individuals who work here. At the end of the day, this is private property. And it's one that people are allowed to ask you to leave.

And it's also on the Minneapolis police department is allowed to enforce trespassing ordinance at this address.

[Nick Shirley]
Yeah. So as we got escorted out of this building, the Somalis filmed us as we left and we headed over to the next building that had 22 of the same home health care providers operating from inside of the building. Right here.

You have multicultural home care. And right here, it says it's open, but can't even get in another reliance recovery center, mercy and grace care, Inc. Right here.

You have Den Den air train, youth development association of Minnesota, another child care center. Welcome to bright beginning center. But what do you guys think about the fraud that's taking place here in Minnesota?

[Speaker 11]
No comments. Can I please right here?

[Nick Shirley]
You have serenity quality care. All of these businesses are literally the same type of business providing the same service in the same building. Another convenience home health care aid, Inc.

And child-friendly space. All these companies get money from the government. Why would you have the same company essentially inside of the same building door to door right here?

Queenly home health care. It just does not make sense. If you're trying to operate a business, you'd want to have less competition.

But here they have all of their competition right next door. We're wondering because we hear there's lots of fraud taking place here in Minnesota, and we're wondering why is there so many of the same companies inside of this same building?

[Speaker 4]
No, I don't know that.

[Nick Shirley]
What do you think about the fraud that's taking place here in Minnesota?

[Speaker 4]
I don't have any idea about that fraud. OK, that's it.

[Nick Shirley]
What do you think about the news articles and what's being spread on the news about the fraud?

[Speaker 4]
Right now you are doing something wrong.

[Nick Shirley]
I'm just asking you. No, you don't have to ask me.

[Speaker 4]
OK, don't ask me that question again.

[Nick Shirley]
OK, who can I speak to? Who can I speak to? OK, as soon as you confirm about the fraud, they get angry.

When these people have these home health care companies, you're seeing them everywhere inside this building. What kind of fraud are they committing?

[Speaker 2]
So there's false documentation being submitted to the state of Minnesota for services never provided. They're having forms signed in advance for services that were then never rendered as far as a year or two years in advance. They'll have someone sign these forms at one sitting, and then they just file those with the state of Minnesota, and nobody from the state of Minnesota bothers to check that those services were ever provided.

[Nick Shirley]
So they're essentially just using people, saying that they had these services provided months or even years ago, then filing the paperwork and then receiving money from the government.

[Speaker 2]
Right, and the Somali community is a very closed community, so everybody's in on it, and they don't want to talk, as you can see.

[Nick Shirley]
And for this building, I'm going to give an estimate of around $30 million for how much fraud is taking place. That is a very low estimate. However, still a lot of money in fraud.

And do you think there is fraud taking place here? Yeah. Do you have any idea what any of these businesses are doing?

I never ask. And now, with upwards of $100 million in fraud, we headed to one more daycare, and this one gets a little spicy as we get chased out at the very end. And after this, we'll be heading to the state capitol to confront the incompetent government leaders who have enabled this fraud to happen.

And I knew this video was going to be super dangerous to film because of obviously how hostile it is, and as we are exposing legit fraud happening. I did get security for this video, and I was able to do it through the Black Line Guardian. And if you guys want to help fund my security in the future, you can go down to the link down below.

They're not paying me to say any of this. They came and decided to help me out for this video. You can go to Black Line Guardian, the link's down below, and click Guardian for Nick, and those funds will directly go to my security in future videos as we are exposing lots of things happening, especially with this fraud.

Like I said, they're not sponsoring this video. I'm just giving them a shout out because of how they helped me. So go down to the link down below, click Guardian for Nick, and let's keep going.

And now we're going to the next location. Now, this child daycare center, this one's different than all the other ones we've been to. Tell us about this one.

[Speaker 2]
This one is different because according to the state of Minnesota, this 312 West Lake Street houses not one, not two, but three child care centers and is licensed to hold 102 children. And in fiscal year 2025 was paid $2.66 million by the state of Minnesota.

[Nick Shirley]
And this is the building right here. So this building alone made $2.6 million. Let's see if anybody's inside.

Now we're inside of the building where there's apparently four child care centers. We met this lady and we followed her to the back of the building where the daycare was supposedly at. So right here we have two child daycare centers.

We have the Minnesota child care center, and then we also have Nuna between the two. $2.66 million. Hello.

Hi. Yes. We would like to know.

[Speaker 2]
Well, it says we're trying to figure out 102 children. Is that for this facility?

[Speaker 8]
What is the name? Why is it?

[Speaker 2]
It's from the state of Minnesota website. It says you have 102 children here in your child care.

[Speaker 8]
Which child care name?

[Speaker 2]
Minnesota child care right here. It's from the state of Minnesota's website. We're just wondering where the children are.

[Speaker 12]
Where the children are?

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, where are the children? It says you have 102 children here and you got $2.66 million this year in funding. And $2.5 million last year. We're just wondering where the kids are.

[Nick Shirley]
My name is Nick Shirley. Nick Shirley. Oh, we are from ourselves.

Hello. We'd like to ask where the money's going. Look at that.

Shut us down. Where are the children at? No children inside of this daycare center.

And look at this daycare center right here. No children inside of this daycare center. But between those buildings, over $2.6 million. We're just curious, where are the children at? Do you know where the children are at? Where are the children at in these daycare centers?

How come these child care centers have no children? There's $2.6 million inside these businesses that were given by the government, but there's no children to be seen anywhere. People deserve to know where their taxes are going.

If these companies and these daycare centers are making upwards of $2.6 million and there's no children to be seen anywhere, something fraudulent is happening. And that is not making you racist, Islamophobic. This is just the truth of what's happening here in Minnesota.

If there's a bunch of white people doing the same thing, we'd be talking about the same issue. This is just fraud at unprecedented levels here inside of Minnesota. It's actually very concerning.

Where are the children at inside of these buildings? They're nowhere to be seen. Millions of dollars are being sent into these daycare centers all across Minnesota, and there's not a child to be seen anywhere.

Here's another daycare center inside the same building.

[Speaker 4]
We don't want you to be videotaping anything.

[Nick Shirley]
Where is all the money going for if there's no children at these daycare centers?

[Speaker 4]
Sir.

[Nick Shirley]
Yes.

[Speaker 4]
I told you, please leave.

[Nick Shirley]
Yes, we have a question though. Where is the children at these daycare centers if there's millions of dollars?

[Speaker 4]
Ask the local government, yeah.

[Nick Shirley]
Oh, we've asked. We have the paper here. So we're wondering where the money and where the children are at.

No, we have the paper right here. Come here.

[Speaker 4]
Who are you, first of all?

[Nick Shirley]
My name is Nick Shirley.

[Speaker 4]
You don't have any permission to record me, period.

[Nick Shirley]
Can we talk outside?

[Speaker 4]
You don't have permission to record.

[Nick Shirley]
She doesn't have permission to record me.

[Speaker 4]
You cannot stop people on the street and question them.

[Nick Shirley]
We can ask.

[Speaker 4]
You don't have any permission.

[Nick Shirley]
Where are the children?

[Speaker 4]
I will sue you. You don't have any permission. We have nothing to do with this.

[Nick Shirley]
Okay, then are there...

[Speaker 4]
So leave. Please leave.

[Nick Shirley]
Are there children here? Please leave. Where are the children?

2.6 million dollars for a daycare center.

[Speaker 4]
You ask whoever you think is doing that. You don't know what you're talking about. So leave.

[Nick Shirley]
Tell us what's happening here then.

[Speaker 4]
I said leave.

[Nick Shirley]
We're wondering what's happening.

[Speaker 4]
We are not a child care. We are nothing to do with you. We're common people walking.

[Nick Shirley]
Yes, we're not accusing you. We're asking where the children are at.

[Speaker 4]
Don't ask me anything.

[Nick Shirley]
We're not accusing you. We're asking the daycare centers.

[Speaker 4]
I am not going to answer and you have...

[Nick Shirley]
Where are the children at?

[Speaker 4]
Leave. Leave.

[Nick Shirley]
We just want to know where are the children? Who you work for? My name is Nick Shirley.

Who do you work for? I work for myself, Nick Shirley.

[Speaker 4]
Okay, what are you recording?

[Nick Shirley]
We're wondering where are the children? 2.66 million dollars for... You're not talking to the right person.

...the Minnesota Child Care Center.

[Speaker 4]
You're not talking to the right person.

[Nick Shirley]
Are there children that come here? Answer the question.

[Speaker 4]
Are there children?

[Nick Shirley]
Leave. There's no children inside this building.

[Speaker 4]
We don't know who you're talking to. Leave.

[Nick Shirley]
That's just a simple question. Where are the children at? David, they won't even answer.

We asked him plain and simple. Where are the children? Do children come here?

[Speaker 2]
This is why I've had my life... I've been attacked twice. Once with a knife and the other time I was jumped last Saturday by three Somali men simply for asking questions about what was going on.

And they're very, very violent people. They do not like this fraud to be exposed.

[Nick Shirley]
After giving this man plenty of opportunities to answer the simple question, where are the children? He called the cops on us and we headed to the state capital where they're having a meeting about the fraud to confront the state representatives and people in the government who have enabled and let this fraud happen. Inside of this committee, a Republican representative showed charts showing exactly how this fraud has been committed and who is profiting and connecting all the dots.

And while the Democrat representatives looked into the abyss, one of them spoke about how none of this is building trust and how this is a nonpartisan issue. So I confronted her after that. He has some very valid questions to ask about what's going on here in Minnesota.

And do you think this fraud... I don't know who you are. My name is Nick Shirley.

Do you think this fraud is Republican or Democrat or just facts that fraud is happening?

[Speaker 3]
So just now they told me it's not true. I think the fact that you talked about it as a partisan issue... Well, because that's what I heard you talking about.

I know. What I said is that what we're talking about is...

[Nick Shirley]
Because we want to build trust, but fraud is fraud. So why should we be enabling fraud to happen here?

[Speaker 3]
No, I don't think anybody is enabling fraud to happen.

[Speaker 7]
No, we're not going to hold Governor Walz accountable for this.

[Speaker 3]
Okay, sir?

[Speaker 7]
No, no, no. When are you going to hold Governor Walz... She is a representative for the state of Minnesota.

Yes or no? Um, excuse me?

[Speaker 3]
Yes. Are you... If you're going to talk to me like that...

[Speaker 7]
Are you going to say I'm a disability advocate?

[Speaker 3]
I heard you. I get over-stimulated.

[Nick Shirley]
Ma'am, the facts are the facts that fraud is happening here and it's not a non-partisan issue. How can you think fraud has been able to happen so much underneath the government here?

[Speaker 3]
I think if you've been listening to our hearings, we've had now 10 hearings on this. And so there's really good data from the people who both work within the administration as well as who, um, both Democrat and Republicans. I think what you heard today is that the Republicans who control this committee are not actually interested in solving fraud.

What they're interested in is telling a story...

[Nick Shirley]
This fraud has happened underneath Democrat leader Tim Walz.

[Speaker 3]
There has been Medicaid fraud across the country under Democrats and Republicans. There's fraud within the Trump administration. We have, it's fraud...

Private providers have made government a mark. And so every person running government, Democrats or Republicans, are dealing with the issue of how to keep fraudsters out of our public payment. We're also dealing with veterans.

We're dealing with consumers. I hope you're looking at that. If you look at UnitedHealth, currently it's being charged with defrauding Medicare.

You know who runs Medicare? President Trump. Medicaid fraud is a 50-state issue.

And so again, it is not a partisan issue. There are Democrats and Republicans who are sitting in that committee talking about it. But what you did here was the Republican chair say she's not turning information over to the one person in government who can stop payment.

And I hope you print that.

[Speaker 7]
This is corrupt. Thank you for coming today. This is crazy.

Well, you saw what happened there. The state of Minnesota that we live in and these politicians are just walking off thinking it's okay to say and they want to go visit the Trump... Do they want to blame the Trump administration?

We have Democrats blaming ICE. I'm tired. My people are suffering.

I'm scared for my little brother.

[Speaker 9]
My people are suffering. And these people just walk off. We have a governor who doesn't care.

How many more people are going to freaking die? How many more people are going to go homeless? And how many more people are going to be trafficked in our freaking system?
