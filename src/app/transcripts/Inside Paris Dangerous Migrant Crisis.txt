This is not the France you would imagine. This is almost like a third world city. Third world country.

Paris, France. What was once a great beacon of light for European nations with beautiful architecture and art has now become nearly an unrecognizable city as the European Union has allowed over 87 million migrants into Europe and a large percentage has entered into France I'm going to show you the effects of migration from scammers at the Eiffel Tower To districts in the heart of Paris that have now become strongholds for immigrant communities. Let's start by going to the Eiffel Tower Look at what happened.

All the scammers are running already. Just got the subway here. They come one two three Look at what?

Just got the subway first impression of France scammers Fleeing Into the subway right as you get off the subway here to go to the Eiffel Tower Scammers just fleeing just got the bird whipped in the face. Here's the police right here All the scammers must have been just right here The police came through right here and now the scammers just went right underneath the subway All these scammers are all coming from the continent of Africa and because of beautiful Exposes on these illegal migrant scammers done by youtubers like tylovera the honest guide and Kurt Kaz I had to get creative So I brought along with me my mother brooker T Jones and my cousin as we were just gonna go about Filming a family vlog making a family memory to see what it's like to try and make a family vlog outside of the Eiffel Tower We're just creating some good family members out here outside the Eiffel Tower and then we'll be moving throughout Paris for the rest of this Video. Here we go, though.

Let's see what happens with all these scammers. Ah, here they are In the boo-boos, how much how much to the boo-boo one minute no video. Hey, okay.

Hey, hey My tourists I was family.

[Speaker 2]

So I love boo-boo. He wants a messy jersey. He just graduated high school senior trip To the play-off what no camera Don't you want a messy Jersey you asking if he has a Ronaldo how much They won't sell us anything why is everyone so mad at the camera The problem with these illegal migrants cameras is you have these businesses here that are paying for a business license They have to pay the taxes.

They have to pay their revenue back to the government because of the taxes, obviously But they have them right here Then you have people over here selling by the tenfolds. Meanwhile, you have people that are trying to run businesses Selling the exact same stuff Meanwhile, those scammers are gonna be able to sell for a lot cheaper and then they want to pay a tax on top of that What do you think about the scammers? Do they make it harder for your business Later in the day this shop closed and then all the sudden all of the scammers came out for the day Here's that all the scammers have been let loose here.

They're literally everywhere. You have one right here This person's getting scammed You have more right here more right there and you have ten people right there and this shop is closed and this guy Apparently doesn't want to get put on camera. Meanwhile, he just sold her some fake stuff.

This is my theory and all these illegal migrant scammers They're all working for one big group here. Because why would you have? Literally nearly a hundred of the same exact shops not even shops They're on blankets that they can take away and run away And if you notice a lot of them are on their phone taking photos Sending it to their whatsapp group chats to try and tell people don't talk to this guy because he is a bad person These scammers they do get extremely hostile Imagine you're just mom coming through here trying to get some family memories get a vlog with the family and you pull out a camera You're gonna get hacked by some scammers here in Paris, France.

This place is crazy Not only do you have people trying to sell you Eiffel Towers everywhere you go You also have Romanian gypsies in groups of two going around asking for signatures for the deaf and blind and then trying to extort you On the spot I sent out my mother brooker T Jones as a decoy to try and lure in two of these scammers And while she was luring in the Romanian gypsies an African man who's trying to sell wristbands for free Tried to scam her as well

He's caught scamming As the police were out it also made all the African Eiffel Tower sellers start scramble happen Hey, hey So if you're gonna come to Paris France to make a family memory And do not pull out a camera at the Eiffel Tower and now to see just how bad the migrant crisis has gotten and Understand how locations like the Eiffel Tower have been conquered by illegal migrants I met up with French journalists to understand and to see the migrant crisis firsthand What can you guys tell me about the immigration here inside of France France became crazy?

[Speaker 2]
We have over 10 million immigrants from out of Europe who came in you in France over the Last 30 years So it's for a population of 70 million people so you can imagine how it changed It changes the face of France and plus they are also a lot concentrated in some point in Paris Of course, we have districts who are fully great replaced where you will not see any native French so there is a population change and It's not going better because every year in France we receive 500,000 immigrants every year Over the eight years that Emmanuel Macron is president. We received over 4 million Stranger in a vast majority who are extra Europeans.

So it's not gonna get better It's gonna only gonna get worse and in France stranger who represents 7% of the population represent 20% of the prisons and in those present you have The majority the biggest number of stranger are the Algerians then we have Moroccans then we have Tunisians Then we hope to have a whole new immigration since around five to ten years is the Afghanis We have a lot of Afghanis We had over a hundred thousand Afghanis who came in France over the last ten years and they have a very high Very very high crime and crime Percentage in these populations.

[Nick Shirley]
We were a woman earlier They said they do not feel safe here in the country of France. And do you feel safe as a woman here in France?

[Speaker 5]
No, for example when you are going in some districts you change your wear You don't choose the street because you are afraid to use the streets A lot of French women have a little paper spray

[Speaker 2]
You think it's because of the mass immigration or was France dangerous before it is hundred percent because of the mass immigration 100% Immigration crime and crime rates are so superior to the native French ones and we have statistics about that There is absolutely no doubt that immigration is the major factor of women's being scared in France There is a lot a lot a lot of sexual harassment in the subways in the trains and stuff Oh, we arrived in Barbès.

You have the smell Basically you can see illegal immigrants who are Sleeping here. There is a certain point where native French cannot stand anymore to see their country change that much This is not France anymore. You're filming you can see it.

I can imagine that American people When they come to Paris, they're not expecting this that they're expecting Emily in Paris and Tour Eiffel and croissant, but no this is French This is France and Paris that people are living every day It's extremely dangerous there's a lot of violence they are fighting between them they are fighting the police Anything can happen And I'm right here. We just have six guys here on the corner all selling stuff drugs cigarettes counterfeit stuff Everything you can imagine you can find it here and do the police do anything the police cannot do anything For a simple reason is that in France judges are all far left Majority of them are far left and every time police stops people they are let alone after 24 hours basically the judge comes and say It's only the 50 times we arrest you. Okay, go away go home. So people start and start again

[Nick Shirley]
So that's why you see so many people that are selling stuff illegally for instance outside the Eiffel Tower Yeah, the police come and then the next day they come back

[Speaker 2]
Of course because they have no risk because there is no more justice in this country because justice has been overpowered by the government of judge and the judges are In the vast majority far left in this country and when these migrants come over here into your guys's country

[Nick Shirley]
Do they blend in with the French people or do they segregate themselves?

[Speaker 2]
There is absolutely no blending and not only there is no blending But they asked to stay with the people from their ethnicity or their country originate original country So, of course, there is no blending because multiculturalism never worked in any country in the world There is not one country in the world where multiculturalism worked Like people need to understand that we are in the center of Paris here we are we're not in in far suburbs or anything you're like 15 or 20 minutes by subway from the Eiffel Tower and this is this is France.

[Nick Shirley]
This is France today Scary Wow, look at this, this is absolutely insane. We're just a few minutes outside of the Eiffel Tower This is the heart of France and just look at all these this is just men too. There's no woman Of course, just men don't have their places in the streets.

It's forbidden by Islamic law Wow Look at this This is not the France you would imagine.

[Speaker 2]
No, this is almost like a third world city Country, it's a third world city in the middle of the beautiful city in the world And you do not have the Paris radio.

[Nick Shirley]
You have the Africa radio. Look at this. You have the Africa radio You're advertising for the Paris 107.5 Where are you guys from?

[Speaker 4]
Me I'm from Algeria. We all from Algeria. Do you guys feel welcomed here in Paris in Paris?

Yes, because there's a lot of us in Paris You don't find yourself like like an immigrant or something because you can see like all those guys there you know, they We are the same and how do you make your money here on the streets on the streets? Things what do you sell like? smoke Cigarettes cigarettes.

[Nick Shirley]
Yeah in France at this train station. It's illegal to sell cigarettes out in public However right here in this train station. It is full of men that are just selling Cigarettes everywhere.

I did film some of these people from above and as soon as one of the guys recognized I was filming He then came and chased me down. All right, he's coming All right, we made it out like I came running up to the stairs after he saw me filming from up the top In the subway station We then headed to one of Paris's largest train stations and what happened here this train station.

[Speaker 9]
Yeah during the last year African migrant with knife kill a man just here in the train station.

[Nick Shirley]
So these guys you guys have guns here No, no, no guns knife. So you guys have a knife problem. Yes.

[Speaker 9]
Yes knife problem.

[Nick Shirley]
So these immigrants are also knifing people Yes. Yes to death.

[Speaker 5]
Yes Yes, it's a big problem in France Yeah, look we got some cigarette sellers right here look you have got some immigrants they are here they don't work They only make traffic and they stay here and nobody make nothing.

[Nick Shirley]
It's wonderful Wow, look at all this all these guys right here all from Africa and like you said, they're all trafficking whether it be cigarettes Drugs you can get all here just outside the train stations here in Paris France. Wow, so that all those guys are trafficking.

[Speaker 9]
Yeah And do police care?

[Nick Shirley]
No, there is no police here The migrant crisis in France is not new people have been coming in for years from small boats where you risk your life to sneaking On semis the migrants journey is not one. I personally envy however now in Europe It's reached a new breaking point as crime and rape are all-time highs and while the EU encourages this migration Many people are suffering both the migrants and the people of the cities in the countries inside the EU and the UK And here in this part of Paris, it is almost unrecognizable now, so and you can see now the market of Barbès

[Speaker 4]
the your work and smell

[Nick Shirley]
This right here is the old Paris and this is the new Paris right here I have a bunch of people living underneath the bridge. They say this is the place for all the crackheads This is the zombie land.

[Speaker 2]
Do all those people are illegal immigrants. You can see there are some Afghanis some sub-saharan Africans and They are staying here They have often state help who comes associations French associations and come give them clothes give them the tents On the tent how you call that the top tents and the the tents are given for free by French association Who are a lot subsidized by the state? So the state is financing his own immigration illegal immigration by giving money to Association who come and help them and the more you help them the more it comes.

It's a natural that when you have Help you will tell your friends. Yes come to Paris. We have money.

We have food. We have a tent We can have housing because those association are telling them they will have free houses and they will they will have free houses knowing that in Paris House pricing became crazy French people French that it cannot live in Paris anymore It's too expensive, but there is so much state apartments like at the communist time There's state apartments and the state give it in favor to immigrants and to illegal immigrants Then to French natives if you come illegally in France You can have a free house given by the state knowing that native French cannot live in Paris anymore It's too expensive. So basically you have very rich people in Paris who live in very nice places out of immigration because there are some districts who are absolutely not touched by mass immigration and Then you have beautiful places like this where you have massive immigration inside now You better be an immigrant who came in France to have house in Paris that if you're a French guy

[Nick Shirley]
How dangerous would you say some of these migrants are because I mean you let in so many people say you let in 1 million People not all of them are gonna be dangerous Of course not, but let's say you let in 1 million people in 10,000 of our dangers How dangerous are the illegal migrants here?

[Speaker 2]
There is not one day where an illegal immigrant doesn't commit a crime not one day in France where an illegal immigrant Is not committing a crime and if it's not killing we have this girl Lola who was 12 years old Who've been killed by an illegal immigrant who was Algerian? She was killed and cut and put in the luggage That happened two or three years ago There is not a day where there is not crimes committed by illegal immigrants And that's the worst because crimes exist everywhere, but there are some crimes you can easily Go against them and not make them happen and by kicking out all illegal immigrants from the country you would lower crime rates So hugely that it's criminal from the state to not do it All of this is because of mass immigration only is the only reason of and because none of those people are French I don't those not we're ninety nine point nine percent sure that they are not those are massively illegal immigrants

[Nick Shirley]
What do women think here about the immigration?

[Speaker 8]
The immigration I think it's a Positive thing you think this is positive for the country. Yeah, I do think it's a positive thing and we are all migrants So you think it's the responsibility you're up to let in everybody Well, I would say so She says it's a positive thing.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, of course You know, that's called mental illness Basically, you saw you filmed everything and even by seeing this they are like, yeah, it's positive That's called mental illness. Yeah, I cannot give it another name when you see all the just human You cannot say that this is positive Unless you have some kind of mental trouble to the Western world to the rest of the Western world Especially the United States.

[Nick Shirley]
What would you say?

[Speaker 2]
The truth is about illegal immigration here in Paris It it's not worth it we it's not worth trying to have Those many illegal and legal immigration because we're losing our country and you're gonna lose yours, too Immigration is the best way to change Definitively the culture and the civilization of a place How many more years until Paris France is unrecognizable? But it's already in recognize like basically you walked with me like for an hour and a half The point is when will it spread to the whole country in less than 20 to 30 years if we continue this way With this mass immigration the country will not be friends. It will be something else.

It will be called maybe Frankistan, but it will not be friends in less than 30 years Wide awakening for the West everybody pay attention
