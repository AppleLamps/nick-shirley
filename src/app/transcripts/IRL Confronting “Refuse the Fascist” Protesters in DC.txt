[Nick Shirley]
Ladies and girls, we're here in Washington, D.C. at the Refuse Fascism protest. It is, I don't even know what day it is, it's a weekday here right now, and you have protesters here on, at 12 p.m. in the afternoon, outside the Washington Monument, here protesting. So today we're going to be confronting these protesters, seeing what they're protesting for, and then go have some nice civil discourse.

Teas are live, this is the third time we've opened up the shop. Go ahead and cop a new tea. Awake is the new woke, as you guys know, wokeism, we're killing it.

Alright, you guys, we're coming through the protest right now, we're going to see what people have to say. The pinned comment above, and also the link in the description, is where you can go ahead and cop yourself a tea and support the channel. We'll also be doing a member-only livestream today, it's $5 a month, help support the channel so we can keep doing these videos.

And we'll be doing a member-only livestream after this stream today. Alright, let's go into the protest, here we go. Just, uh, okay, let me figure out what day this is actually.

It's been a long week. Alright, it's Wednesday. Alright, it's Wednesday, everybody.

We got some Antifa flags right off the bat. They have an Antifa registration up here. Let's see what the people have to say.

Can you imagine coming here as a tourist, you're like, oh, sweet, we're coming to Washington, D.C. on a Wednesday, and then you get a nice protest. How you doing, sir? Alright, let's go through here.

Hello, hello. Wow, let's see what these protesters have to say. Liberty, not tyranny, one says.

I think they're gonna be marching on to the Washington Monument as well. Let's see this, let me see this thing. Alright, so right here, right off the get-go, you have an Antifa registration sign right here.

Where can I register?

[Speaker 20]
I like that shirt, bro.

[Nick Shirley]
Thank you, I like the shirt as well. Where can we register to become part of Antifa? What's that?

Are you guys? What is your name?

[Speaker 17]
I got a video of you last night.

[Nick Shirley]
We were here. Right off the get-go. Benefits of joining Antifa.

You don't have to pretend to be sad when terrible people die. Right here, it says, Benefits of joining Antifa. You don't have to pretend to be sad when terrible people die.

You get to engage with people who may not agree with you on everything, but still have human decency. Outside of the Washington Monument, you have an official Antifa registration. This lady's shirt says, Stephen Miller is Satan.

What makes you think Stephen Miller is Satan?

[Speaker 41]
Well, her number's number across. They have to figure out how to... I was right there yelling at them.

[Nick Shirley]
How do we register to become part of Antifa? Yeah, I like... The shirt, Stephen Miller is Satan.

What inspired that one?

[Speaker 4]
Well, he's Satan.

[Nick Shirley]
Satan. Alright, we're registering to become part of Antifa here. Okay.

[Speaker 41]
Now you can just write whatever you want on there. Street name, real name. You can write you've been a member since whenever you decided to join.

Whatever you want.

[Nick Shirley]
Awesome. I'm registered. Am I registered now?

Yep.

[Speaker 41]
You have an official membership card.

[Nick Shirley]
Antifa member. Ricky Bobby's officially a member of Antifa. And one minute...

Alright, we'll move on here. Trump must go now. Wow.

How you doing, ma'am? What are your thoughts on today, the protest?

[Speaker 32]
Oh, I don't really want to be... Photographed or filmed, but thank you.

[Nick Shirley]
Oh, okay, you're just out here...

[Speaker 32]
I'm just out here doing my thing.

[Nick Shirley]
What's your thing out here?

[Speaker 32]
I really don't want to be filmed or photographed, sorry.

[Nick Shirley]
No worries. Alright, let's move on through here. Wow, we've probably got a...

Maybe roughly 500,000 people up here. Hello, how are you, ma'am? Yo, how's it going, sir?

Would you like a sign? Sure, I'll take a sign.

[Speaker 28]
Any donation would be welcome, but totally voluntary.

[Nick Shirley]
Okay, what's the sign say? Trump must go now. How do you guys get rid of Trump?

Millions of people.

[Speaker 28]
This is just the beginning. Storm the White House? We gotta surround the White House, surround the Supreme Court, which seems to back everything he does.

[Nick Shirley]
And how do we get the government to reopen?

[Speaker 28]
We'll see. He's overruling everybody that speaks against him in the government.

[Nick Shirley]
Who do you think is to blame for the government shutdown? What are you doing, man? Don't talk to this guy.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, settle down.

[Speaker 28]
What's going on? Wait, why? You're saying don't do interviews?

[Nick Shirley]
Wait, we were just talking. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What's the problem here?

Can he not do interviews? We were just having a conversation. He's asked you to leave.

[Speaker 31]
He's asked you to leave.

[Nick Shirley]
Did the boss come through or what? I need help. Now they're yelling for help.

That was crazy. His guy nearly looked like he was about to tackle him for having to do an interview. The boss came through.

Yeah, we don't want to get your... We don't want to get your boss pissed off, that's for sure. What the heck?

What makes you so mad? What the heck just happened? Wow.

Why'd he get so mad? Who's the boss here? Can I go talk to the boss?

Now we got walkie-talkie coming through here. Whoa. You guys, boss just came through here and said, do not be talking to this guy.

That was a little weird, if you ask me. Are you guys alright? Yo.

[Speaker 31]
If somebody says they don't want to be recorded, you don't record them.

[Nick Shirley]
I know, but... I was talking to him and some boss man came through here and nearly tackled your guy right there saying, you better move. You can't talk to him.

But he was talking to me right before then. So that's a little weird, sir.

[Speaker 31]
I don't want any problems either. So if somebody says... If somebody don't want to interview, don't interview them.

[Nick Shirley]
Yeah, we won't do that. We won't interview them if they don't want to. But he was having a great conversation and then all of a sudden boss man came through.

That was weird. Alright, you guys. Now they're calling in the yellow vest.

That was crazy. What's your book say?

[Speaker 45]
It's a survival guide to neo-fascism.

[Nick Shirley]
What do you think then? Can you describe neo-fascism?

[Speaker 45]
Well, you have to buy the book.

[Nick Shirley]
You have to buy the book. You sell lots of books out here?

[Speaker 32]
It's mostly just definition-based. But it ties into the two-party duopoly and how it's just recreating these extremist systems and that.

[Nick Shirley]
Do you think Trump's a fascist?

[Speaker 32]
I think he's authoritarian.

[Nick Shirley]
Authoritarian?

[Speaker 32]
Yeah, leaning towards fascism.

[Nick Shirley]
Do you think there's a lot of misinformation in this world these days? Yes, there really is. How are you doing, sir?

The empires. How long did this take you to write this book? It's impressive.

I like the artwork. She's doing a good job. If you'd like to support the survival guide of neo-fascism, you can come here to Washington, D.C. outside the Washington Monument. Thank you. God bless you. Thank you so much.

It's a good shirt, huh? You like this shirt? A lot of people like this shirt out here today, right?

Thank you so much, man. You can go ahead and cop it at ShirleyDefense.com. Wow.

How are you doing? We've got pins out here. And now we've got the yellow vest people following me.

Wow, we've got quite the crowd out here. Look at this. How do we already have the orange vest coming through?

We've got orange vest guys coming through here already trying to sabotage.

[Speaker 40]
What's in it?

[Nick Shirley]
How do we stop them?

[Speaker 40]
You want the simple answer? The simple answer is this. Millions and tens of millions of people in the street to create a political earthquake from below that forces this regime from power.

That is the simple answer. Through non-violent protest. That's the simple answer.

[Nick Shirley]
Bro, what is going on? All these bosses are coming through here telling the guys they can't talk to me. That is just crazy.

That just shows that this is some big organization controlling who can talk and who can't talk here. It's already been exposed just in the past five minutes since we've been here. Yellow vests are coming through here making it so as soon as they talk to somebody they freak out and want to make sure that their guys don't say anything in contrary of what the RefusedFascism.org website says, I guess.

[Speaker 11]
How are you doing?

[Nick Shirley]
What brought you out here today?

[Speaker 8]
Well, I got to I got to celebrate myself.

[Nick Shirley]
Yeah.

[Speaker 8]
The Great Gadfly.

[Nick Shirley]
The Heart of Ice. Do you think the deportation of illegal migrants is a bad thing? Oh, as myself?

Do you think the deportation of illegal migrants is a bad thing? Am I a protester? Which one?

You're a protester. Oh, no. I thought I was.

[Speaker 22]
What this guy is doing, believe me. He's a nightmare.

[Speaker 11]
Yeah.

[Speaker 22]
A nightmare on 16th Street.

[Nick Shirley]
Thank you so much. Have a good day. How's it going, sir?

[Speaker 22]
Honored to meet you.

[Nick Shirley]
Nice to meet you, too. Very nice, very nice. Watch out for the people in the orange vests.

[Speaker 22]
Oh, dude, I've had several people shot down, but we got it on tape.

[Nick Shirley]
They're ridiculous. Look, who do we got here? Is this the Hans Rage walking through here?

[Speaker 11]
Look, we got the Hans...

[Nick Shirley]
What the hell is happening here in Washington, D.C. right now? More scenes from D.C. Can you explain what you guys are dressed up as today? And the shame that you feel for the country?

Can you explain what you're dressed up as today and the shame you're feeling for the country today? What about you? Can you explain the outfit and the shame that you're feeling today for the country?

[Speaker 30]
Yeah, we're here representing the Handmaid's Tale, the series, and the erosion of women's rights in our country under the Trump regime.

[Nick Shirley]
How do you feel like your rights are being taken away as a woman here?

[Speaker 30]
Particularly the SAVE Act, the overturning of Roe v. Wade, to start with, eliminating certain forms of birth control and making access more difficult, eliminating Planned Parenthood. These are all erosions of women's rights.

[Nick Shirley]
Awesome. Well, thank you guys for being out here today. Have a good day.

We're moving more and going back in.

[Speaker 11]
For Sal, Palm Boundy, USA.

[Nick Shirley]
Can I pull?

[Speaker 34]
Pull? Yes, sir.

[Nick Shirley]
Yes, sir. And what do you have right here? Trash.

People are saying they like your arts and crafts.

[Speaker 24]
Wow.

[Nick Shirley]
What interesting scenes for a Wednesday afternoon.

[Speaker 24]
Let me pull up the chat in here.

[Nick Shirley]
Now they're chanting songs about that they are not illegal. They have a whole stage set up here.

[Speaker 24]
How are you doing?

[Nick Shirley]
All right, so we have Swear Her In. Who should they swear in? Who should they swear in?

Who's she?

[Speaker 27]
She's the representative-elect of Arizona. She hasn't been sworn in.

[Nick Shirley]
Yeah, because of the government shutdown, that lady?

[Speaker 27]
Yeah, but he's actually... Mike Johnson has already sworn in two other Democrats who won elections during pro forma. He hasn't done it with her.

[Nick Shirley]
When do you think the government is going to reopen?

[Speaker 27]
Whenever they get their shit together.

[Nick Shirley]
Who do you think is to blame for the government shutdown? Republicans. And how many times have they voted to reopen the government?

[Speaker 27]
No idea, but guess what? They have the majority. If they need something to pass, they should go in the middle of the table and negotiate.

[Nick Shirley]
There should be some negotiations going on. And you think illegals should continue to get health care?

[Speaker 27]
Illegals do not get health care established in statute and law. That's just a fake talking point.

[Nick Shirley]
It is? Thank you so much. Have a good day.

The illegals getting free health care is not a fake talking point. I've interviewed multiple illegal migrants outside of shelters in New York City and they themselves got free health care, free food stamps, free shelter, everything like that. So that is not a lie.

I've seen it first hand. That is not just some lie. Only you can stop fascist liars.

[Speaker 24]
Impeach says right here.

[Nick Shirley]
Fight the radical right. How are you doing? How do you think we have so many people out here on a Wednesday afternoon?

[Speaker 16]
We've got to fight.

[Nick Shirley]
Yeah, we've got to fight, right? What's your main fight against? You said the radical right?

What fears you most about the radical right? Or what are they doing that's so radical right now?

[Speaker 16]
Behaving unconstitutionally, acting unconstitutionally, trying to take away our First Amendment rights.

[Nick Shirley]
How do you feel they're trying to take away the First Amendment?

[Speaker 16]
Donald Trump is literally saying he's calling everybody else this radical, lunatic left just because we're not allowed to speak our, whatever we want, we're not allowed to speak. We're not allowed to speak right now.

[Nick Shirley]
Did you ever feel like the First Amendment was under attack when Biden was in office with that censorship that we saw in mainstream media?

[Speaker 24]
No.

[Nick Shirley]
You never felt like it was under attack?

[Speaker 24]
No.

[Nick Shirley]
Do you think Elon Musk has been a net benefit for the First Amendment? No. Do you think Mark Zuckerberg unrestricting Facebook after the Biden restrictions has been a good thing or a bad thing?

[Speaker 16]
Who are you representing?

[Nick Shirley]
My name's Nick Shirley.

[Speaker 16]
And who do you represent? Myself. And what is your sub?

Why are you asking me questions? I don't like being bombarded with questions right now. Thank you.

My work is suffering. My business is suffering because of all of these layoffs that have been going on, these furloughs. I'm sorry, but it affects me.

I see that my kids are going to end up with horribly expensive health insurance premiums is upsetting me. So when you're bombarding me with questions and I feel like they're leading me to something, I don't appreciate you right now.

[Nick Shirley]
Okay, no worries. I hope they do bring down the cost of health care, though.

[Speaker 16]
It's going to take a lot of work. It's going to take the Republicans, Mike Johnson, to find— Well, first of all, let's release the Epstein-Fausts.

[Nick Shirley]
Okay.

[Speaker 24]
Thank you very much.

[Nick Shirley]
Have a good day. It's so loud right here, everybody. The music they got going on.

Let's move back a little bit more. Their idea of the First Amendment is a little crazy when it was openly known that they were censoring people on platforms like Twitter, Facebook, YouTube. Now they're unrestricted, those censorship places.

But let's keep moving on. How are you guys doing? Ask Trump?

Are you guys going to be marching to the Lincoln Memorial? Or is it just staying here today?

[Speaker 18]
I think we're just staying here today.

[Nick Shirley]
What's your sign say?

[Speaker 24]
Don't answer? Oh, okay. Okay, no worries.

[Nick Shirley]
Have a good day. We're going to stay out here on the outskirts because the speakers are just too loud over there.

[Speaker 24]
Refuse fascism!

[Nick Shirley]
They're yelling, refuse fascism.

[Speaker 24]
Everyone out here today!

[Nick Shirley]
Crazy. And yes, we should refuse fascism. Keep the camera up a little bit.

Thank you very much, JFO. Hey Nick, make America great again. Donald Trump, MAGA, parents raised you right.

Woohoo, woohoo, woohoo. Thank you very much. And also thank you again.

Keep kicking, major ass, Nick. We all love you. Tell them proper diet and exercise.

All right. ICE equals American Gestapo. How are you guys doing?

What brings you guys out here on this fine Wednesday? I came out here to talk to people like you, so we're curious. What's your sign say?

Silence is compliance. Time to act up. Your sign says ICE is American Gestapo.

Do you think they should deport illegal migrants?

[Speaker 5]
They shouldn't be taking people off the streets, children and people of any color without proper due course or any reason other than the color.

[Nick Shirley]
If you were president, how would you go about deporting illegal migrants?

[Speaker 5]
My first worry would be do they need to be deported? Just because they're here illegal doesn't mean they have to be deported. Maybe they're in the process of becoming illegal.

Even if they are illegal, they are still part of the backbone of this country. Our food comes from them.

[Nick Shirley]
Have you had any hard times getting food since Trump's been in office at the grocery store?

[Speaker 5]
The prices have definitely gone up. I see it from week to week, it increases.

[Nick Shirley]
As far as there being produce and stuff like that, that was a big concern about who's going to pick the strawberries, who's going to do that sort of stuff. Have you seen a decrease of strawberries in Europe?

[Speaker 5]
I have not noticed as of yet.

[Nick Shirley]
When it comes to so many people being out here, what do you think this says about the current state of America? Would you say we're more divided than ever right now?

[Speaker 5]
It is more divided, but I'm hoping with rallies like this, it's going to bring more people together because in order to make this better or correct it, we do have to come together.

[Nick Shirley]
Right now with the government shutdown, how much longer do you think the government shutdown is going to go on for right now? A lot of people aren't getting paid.

[Speaker 5]
It's discouraging. I don't know. I think he wants to demoralize as much as possible and blame the other side.

So unfortunately, I think it's going to go on longer than we think.

[Nick Shirley]
What do you think the main reason is for them not opening back up the government?

[Speaker 5]
It's another power play. It's something, whatever chapter we're on in Project 2025.

[Nick Shirley]
Do you think there will ever be a day underneath the Trump administration where Democrats and Republicans can sit down and have actual civil discourse and come to agreements on something?

[Speaker 5]
You can still disagree, but still look out for people and still care for people.

[Nick Shirley]
Do you think it's kind of a lie from the right that the reason why they're not reopening the government is because they don't want to give health care to illegal migrants and continue giving benefits to people who aren't illegal here in the United States?

[Speaker 5]
I think that's just a teeny tiny portion of it. They take some small percentage and make it out to be something huge that it's not. Like how they were trying to say, we're deporting the illegal aliens because they're the ones who are creating all the crime.

It's untrue. Statistically, they do not create the crime.

[Nick Shirley]
Yeah, but it would be kind of like unnecessary crime if there was crime from illegal migrants, right?

[Speaker 5]
Say that again?

[Nick Shirley]
It would be kind of unnecessary. Like that crime wouldn't be necessary if they didn't come to the agreement.

[Speaker 5]
Yeah, there's going to be crime no matter what. But the statistics are so low for the illegal immigrants that are committing those crimes. It's so low.

And there's no country out there that doesn't have immigrants. We are no different. What we're different is how we're treating them.

[Nick Shirley]
Thank you guys so much for being out here. Quite the scene. Are you guys going to be marching to Lincoln Memorial?

When does that march start?

[Speaker 5]
I think at 1 o'clock today.

[Nick Shirley]
So hopefully more people show up then?

[Speaker 5]
Well, this is just day one.

[Nick Shirley]
Day one? How many days are you guys going to be out here for?

[Speaker 5]
There's been a call across the nation to flood the capital. This is day one. They said, come and stay as long as you can.

[Nick Shirley]
How long do you plan on staying here for?

[Speaker 5]
I'll be here today and tomorrow. Wow.

[Nick Shirley]
I didn't know that. So they're flooding the capital.

[Speaker 5]
Resist Fascism is who's sponsoring this.

[Nick Shirley]
Who do you think sponsors the Resist Fascist organization?

[Speaker 5]
I don't know who the creators are, but it's all through volunteers. They organized, obviously, this one. They want to make it as safe and peaceful as possible.

They've organized people to come in and help with housing. They've organized people to be bused in if they want to come.

[Nick Shirley]
Awesome. Thank you so much. Did you get bused in here?

[Speaker 5]
No, I flew in. Wow.

[Nick Shirley]
Did you pay for your flight?

[Speaker 5]
I did. All the way from Alaska?

[Nick Shirley]
You're one of the first ladies I ever met from Alaska.

[Speaker 5]
And this is my first time in D.C. to see this.

[Nick Shirley]
Isn't Washington, D.C. beautiful? I love coming to Washington, D.C. The National Mall is just awesome, isn't it? It is gorgeous.

Awesome. I hope you have a great time here and enjoy your few days protesting from Alaska. That's quite amazing you came that far.

Awesome. Thank you very much. Have a good day.

Wow. That lady came all the way from Alaska to come out here. That is far away.

Do we have anybody from Alaska in the chat? That is far. That's probably like a seven-hour flight at least.

[Speaker 3]
Those that rule over us? Families.

[Nick Shirley]
How are you guys doing? What's your sign say?

[Speaker 7]
Many things.

[Nick Shirley]
You not Don. The guy is nuts. The day starts like any other.

Killing unknowns in international waters. Demolishing history. The Constitution, democracy, lies, lies, lies.

Insurrection, January 6th. Sexual assault, felon. Extortion, bribery, coercion.

Cheating, absolute immunity. By his court, tyrant, dictator, the devil's work. Un-American.

Do you think them bombing and killing people on international waters are drug dealers? Do you think that's a good or bad thing for America?

[Speaker 7]
It's bad. It's in international waters for one thing. You can't just kill somebody because you think they're committing a crime.

They don't even know the person's name. They don't really know where they came from. It's not what America does.

That's what maybe places like Russia do or Venezuela. That's not what Americans do.

[Nick Shirley]
What kind of message do you think that sends to the foreign cartels?

[Speaker 7]
I can't say that. I don't know what kind of connections he has, but the whole thing about the new AI industrial complex, let's put it that way, there's all kinds of messy connections there. Dark money is everywhere.

I can't even pinpoint it. It's such a mess. You can't trust hardly anything anymore.

[Nick Shirley]
As far as them bombing the cartel ships that are coming in with drugs, do you think that's a good or bad thing for America to kill and take care of the drugs before they come onto our land?

[Speaker 7]
I don't know why they aren't talking more about why are Americans taking the drugs in the first place? What are they doing about that? They don't talk about that at all.

Evidently, there's more people taking drugs than we can even imagine. Trump has an ad out of this guy who's taken fentanyl and he turned blue. I've never seen anybody die of fentanyl, but they have this ad on where the guy is turning blue and his hair is coming out.

Really? That's scare tactics.

[Nick Shirley]
Fentanyl is really bad.

[Speaker 7]
I know it is, but that's not a good example. I think young kids would say, come on, and then you find out that people mix fentanyl with other things and they survive it. I never took drugs, but that's a really bad ad.

[Nick Shirley]
Can I tell you some facts about fentanyl? It's 50 times more powerful than heroin. It does cause things like your limbs.

If you go down to places where people do fentanyl, you'll see a lot of people in wheelchairs because it eats at their limbs. You'll see a lot of people with no legs because the fentanyl causes their body to rot. When they do try to get off the drugs, they start puking, diarrhea.

It's like the worst drug imaginable.

[Speaker 7]
A video of that would be more impressive than this stupid ad that Trump has on.

[Speaker 21]
No, we're not.

[Nick Shirley]
I can send you one. I made a video on it in Kensington, Philadelphia. It's really bad.

Make sure it's on YouTube. You'll probably like it.

[Speaker 7]
The point is that Trump's ad is really a cheap shot. It's a joke. If there are better videos, if you know where they are, they should put them on TV and scare people to stop using it.

That's all I can say.

[Nick Shirley]
We're part of that mission trying to scare people away from fentanyl. It's pretty bad in this country right now. Really bad.

Lots of people are dying. Go to any big city. Have you ever seen somebody when you're driving out here in the streets and they're folded over like this?

No.

[Speaker 7]
There's a lot of alcoholics around here.

[Nick Shirley]
That's what's called the fentanyl fold. They're stuck in fentanyl. It zombifies them.

They can't move. They lose power in their back. They're sleeping, standing up.

You tap them and they'll stand back up. It's pretty crazy.

[Speaker 7]
Yeah, it is. I don't deal with that. I don't know those people.

The society is supposed to take care of those kind of people. I don't think they are.

[Nick Shirley]
Thank you very much, sir. God bless you. Wow, look at this sign right here.

I love dick and I love taters. But she does not love dick taters. Excuse me, ma'am.

We would love to see your sign right here. Thank you. You love dick.

[Speaker 23]
Probably too much for my own good.

[Nick Shirley]
Wow, awesome. And you love some taters as well.

[Speaker 23]
Taters are great.

[Nick Shirley]
What's your favorite place to get taters?

[Speaker 23]
Waffle House.

[Nick Shirley]
I prefer the McDonald's ones. Those are good. They used to only be a dollar too.

[Speaker 23]
I bought some at Union Station the other day. They were six bucks. That was bullshit.

[Nick Shirley]
You don't love the dick and the tater together.

[Speaker 23]
I don't love the dictator.

[Nick Shirley]
Do you think Trump is that dictator? I do. What makes you think Trump is a dictator?

[Speaker 23]
I am most disturbed by the occupation of D.C. and other cities by the National Guard.

[Nick Shirley]
Do you think it's bad to use the National Guard to make the city safer?

[Speaker 23]
The National Guard can't make the city safer.

[Nick Shirley]
Do you think their presence makes it safer?

[Speaker 23]
No.

[Nick Shirley]
Would it surprise you if crime had gone down in Washington, D.C.? Crime was going down in Washington, D.C. before. Would it surprise you if it's gone down even more since they brought in the National Guard?

[Speaker 23]
It may have. It's a coincidence. The National Guard can't do any more for crime than you or I can.

They can observe. They can call the police. But because of Posse Colbertatus laws...

[Nick Shirley]
Yeah. Just the other weekend, you saw a bunch of kids go after National Guard because they realized they actually can't arrest them.

[Speaker 23]
We had friends who were there. The National Guard actually instigated that shit.

[Nick Shirley]
I saw those videos. I was like, what the heck is happening here in Washington, D.C.? We saw the sign. We want to come and talk to you.

Ask about your love for Dick and Taters.

[Speaker 24]
Dick died yesterday. Dick died yesterday.

[Speaker 23]
Dick Cheney. That was a great birthday present for me. It wasn't the big, beautiful obit I wanted to see, but it was a good one.

[Nick Shirley]
We got some clowns over here as well. You have a great day, ma'am.

[Speaker 24]
Thank you.

[Nick Shirley]
You too. We got the clowns coming out. How are you guys doing?

[Speaker 36]
Good. How about you?

[Nick Shirley]
What inspired the outfits today?

[Speaker 36]
I don't want to do any more interviews.

[Nick Shirley]
No more interviews? Come on. Have a good one.

They're going to be here all week here in Washington, D.C. They're going to be occupying D.C., they say. That's crazy.

[Speaker 3]
Thank you, Stephen B. How are you guys doing?

[Nick Shirley]
What brings you guys out here on a Wednesday afternoon? I want to know how all these people have unless they work for the government how are they out here? Some people from Portland are here.

I saw on X that they're here as well. People from the Portland protest at the ICE building, they're here. Let's see what these organizers are saying.

And look, we're just a beautiful Washington monument.

[Speaker 3]
Now we got all the protesters out here. But the fact that we are thousands and not yet millions does not change the truth that I have just spoken. So in a very real sense we are a lot like the abolitionists back before the Civil War.

They were small in numbers. They were ahead of where even most decent people in society were at. But they were right.

They said slavery could not be compromised with. It had to be abolished. We say the same of fascism today.

It cannot be lived with. It cannot be contained. It must be defeated.

It must be non-violently driven from power. They lived in a country whose contradictions had reached a breaking point.

[Nick Shirley]
So do we.

[Speaker 3]
When those in power are this bitterly divided and at each other's throats. When people in their millions are in motion. When the whole fabric of society is being ripped apart.

A minority that is right. That acts with conviction. That does not relent.

That minority can move millions and change history. This is what we aim to do. This is what we are launching today.

We did not come here to make a statement. We came here to make history. So if you came for the day I want you to decide if you can stay.

If you're hearing about this but missed it get to D.C. and join us. We are going out tomorrow to the campuses to rally the students. We are standing in front of the Supreme Court for our LGBTQ sisters and brothers and siblings on Friday.

We are standing up every day challenging this regime and calling on people to join us. We aim to grow right now. We are going to have more action.

[Nick Shirley]
We are going to have more two and money for 17 and you and your partners in the movement coalition on the 20th through the 22nd right here in D.C. Get here. Join us. Join us now.

So as we go forward there are people who are trying to divide us and we cannot let them.

[Speaker 3]
We have to unite all who can be united from different perspectives. It's going to take us all to stop Trump fascism. Some will try to attack us and we need to use every attack to further expose the illegitimacy and bankruptcy of this regime.

[Nick Shirley]
We need to rally more people to join this movement to drive it from power. I hope you like them.

[Speaker 3]
Some people get frustrated and give up on moving the millions but we cannot give up on this and bringing them forced down violent sustained protests because this is how we can win.

[Nick Shirley]
We got some protesters taking a nap right now using the signs to block out the sun.

[Speaker 3]
It's weird.

[Nick Shirley]
They all have signs. They all have shirts. They have a whole entire stage here with a podium and everything like that.

Kind of crazy. Fallon liar 8647 rapist thief. What brings you out here today on this Wednesday?

[Speaker 3]
I'm hearing more and more of my neighbors and I'm just proud of people for standing up and saying how ridiculous and how wrong Trump is.

[Nick Shirley]
Right now they're using the words like Hitler to compare Trump. Do you think it's fair to compare Trump to somebody like Hitler? Look at him.

Show the cameras. Show the cameras.

[Speaker 3]
We got paparazzi out here today.

[Nick Shirley]
It's not paparazzi. Bring it back. Do you think it's fair to compare somebody like Trump to Hitler?

[Speaker 3]
My father taught in World War II I ask you to put your fist in the air and join me.

[Nick Shirley]
a fascist America Trump must go now! Trump must go now! And as far as like, do you think it's just what he's doing you compared to Hitler?

As far as like the deportations or do you compare it to how he's ruling the United States and controlling the White House?

[Speaker 9]
He's treating people as illegal. You're not illegal. No, I was born here.

[Speaker 3]
It doesn't matter.

[Speaker 9]
He thinks you're illegal if you talk back to him. I'm many generations here, but he doesn't like me. If I went to an ICE demonstration and said shame, I might be arrested.

[Nick Shirley]
Really? You think so? That's crazy.

Do you know friends who have been arrested for saying shame? Yes. Really?

Do they like put their hands on the police or anything or do they just go grab them?

[Speaker 9]
No. They just yell shame.

[Nick Shirley]
And then the police just arrest them for saying shame?

[Speaker 9]
I think that happens.

[Nick Shirley]
You think that happens? And do you know any, a lot of people out here are mad because they think American citizens are being deported. Do you know any American citizens who have been deported?

[Speaker 9]
Not personally, but personally. But I come to these events and the stories are real. Like Michael Fanon talking about January 6th.

I watched that on television and I cried and I called my governor and I said send the National Guard. They should have sent the National Guard. They did send the National Guard, but it wasn't because I called.

[Nick Shirley]
Good job. You might have brought the National Guard to D.C. That might have been all you, man.

[Speaker 24]
I live in Maryland.

[Nick Shirley]
You know, that phone call might have been a powerful one. Can you tell me a story about the Handmaid's, these ladies over here?

[Speaker 9]
The Handmaid's Tale is a story written by Margaret Atwood. And it's dysfunctional, imaginary fiction.

[Nick Shirley]
Was it like women who were suppressed or something like that?

[Speaker 9]
Yes. But the voting away of Roe, the right to choose, it made it seem like, oh, hey, this is a new world. And it's good that you read.

It's good that people read because not everybody lives all these difficult stories. But the creative imagination of Margaret Atwood revealed this. And it helps people understand the fascist possibilities.

So where are you from?

[Nick Shirley]
I am from Utah, where I was born. I was born in Utah. My stepson lives in Utah.

It's a pretty nice, chill state, chill place. I don't live there now, as of right now, but it's kind of just bouncing all across the country. But it was nice talking to you, man.

What do you mean by 8-6-4-7?

[Speaker 9]
Deep six. If something's being 86, it's being a deep hole.

[Nick Shirley]
Death. Six feet under. Or only like one foot under.

Six foot. And 47 is Trump. So basically calling to kill Trump.

No. Put him underneath the ground, that means kill him.

[Speaker 9]
Get rid of him.

[Nick Shirley]
Okay. And put him underneath the ground.

[Speaker 44]
Well, someday.

[Nick Shirley]
Thank you, ma'am. I hope you have a great day.

[Speaker 44]
God bless you.

[Nick Shirley]
We got the pirates out here. What's the pirate flag for?

[Speaker 6]
One Piece. One Piece is an anime that Gen Z has found their democracy in. So I'm here from not Gen Z to let them know that we love them and make sure that their sign is flying right with the American flag for this democracy.

[Nick Shirley]
I feel loved right now.

[Speaker 6]
Do you know about One Piece at all?

[Nick Shirley]
I just see the flag. I just see the pirates. I think of Jack Sparrow.

[Speaker 6]
Well, there's a pirate. His name is Monkey Luffy in the cartoon. And he's their leader.

And they just make good things happen. They're good pirates.

[Nick Shirley]
Do you think more people should act like pirates?

[Speaker 6]
Well, if they know how to be the right kind of pirate.

[Nick Shirley]
What's the right kind of pirate do?

[Speaker 6]
It's love.

[Nick Shirley]
What's the right kind of pirate?

[Speaker 6]
Love over money. So the pirate then can love and care about his crew and his ship compared to somebody who just wants to take everybody's money. Pirates are real civil, right?

I think they are. They're going to be in this new future.

[Nick Shirley]
In the past were they civil?

[Speaker 6]
I think they were pretty good. I believe the Vikings were a little more ruthless. And then as things evolved.

But you'd have to check the history. I know the future is going to have good pirates.

[Speaker 28]
Oh, okay.

[Nick Shirley]
Well, I don't think in the past the pirates were that good. What's that now? I don't think in the past the pirates were that good.

Lots of battles. Well, there's a lot of raping in pilgrimage. Yeah, so maybe not advocate for pirates.

[Speaker 6]
Well, no. It's not really about pirates.

[Nick Shirley]
It's about democracy.

[Speaker 24]
So don't get swayed.

[Nick Shirley]
The pirates live underneath democracy? Or is that more like a fascist rule there? Like one guy leading the ship.

[Speaker 6]
It's about unity. Just like the costumes that are really for Halloween. Those make us feel unity.

Like a uniform. Because we're trying to step up against this.

[Nick Shirley]
What if we all showed up in inflatable costumes? That would be awesome. To show Trump that we're all in uniform.

[Speaker 6]
That would be awesome. We'd probably get knocked over and pummeled. But it shows unity.

Whatever we can do to love each other. Come on.

[Nick Shirley]
Yeah, maybe we should just give everybody inflatable costumes. And say, let's go to the doorstep of the White House.

[Speaker 6]
Be worth more money than some of the expenses that they've been doing lately. But we don't want to waste cash.

[Nick Shirley]
We don't want to waste any cash. I don't like when they send money over to other countries and stuff like that. I'm like, come on, get in here.

[Speaker 6]
I'm sure there's issues. I'm sure there's issues. But you and I are communicating right now.

They should be able to communicate too. This shit should be able to get resolved.

[Nick Shirley]
We should be able to open up the government, shouldn't we?

[Speaker 6]
Right?

[Nick Shirley]
They voted so many times.

[Speaker 6]
I think they just need like five more times.

[Nick Shirley]
I think they just need like five more Democrats, right?

[Speaker 6]
You know who's not here in D.C., right?

[Nick Shirley]
Oh, Trump, he's in Florida right now.

[Speaker 6]
No, no, no, I don't care about his ass.

[Nick Shirley]
He was here this morning.

[Speaker 6]
The Republicans are not here. The Democrats are here to work.

[Nick Shirley]
Really?

[Speaker 6]
Yeah. Yeah. They never left.

It's the Republicans that left. It's really sorry they don't know how to do their jobs.

[Nick Shirley]
I know. I think everyone should just come to the table and figure out how to reopen the government.

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, we agree with that.

[Nick Shirley]
A lot of people don't have their SNAP benefits and stuff like that.

[Speaker 6]
I don't get to get a paycheck unless I do my job.

[Nick Shirley]
Mm-hmm.

[Speaker 6]
Isn't that crazy? All right.

[Nick Shirley]
Glad you guys are out here. Yep. Have a good day, ma'am.

[Speaker 11]
Thank you.

[Nick Shirley]
Keep the pirate movement going strong.

[Speaker 42]
It's like real life Looney Tunes out here, you guys.

[Nick Shirley]
All right, thank you, Steve and Bea. As a gay man in Connecticut, I do not fall for the left or LGBTQ mob, hate or ignorance. They are fascists.

They are destroying this company. They are being brainwashed by the powers that be. Wake up.

I agree. A lot of people out here are getting brainwashed that Trump's some sort of fascist in reality. I don't think Trump's a fascist.

[Speaker 42]
It's kind of crazy.

[Nick Shirley]
Apparently, they're going to be marching down to the Lincoln Monument.

[Speaker 42]
How are you doing today, sir?

[Nick Shirley]
Good. How long do you plan on being here in D.C. for?

[Speaker 42]
What's that?

[Nick Shirley]
How long do you plan on being here in D.C. for? They're trying to get everyone here in D.C. to drive them out, they just said.

[Speaker 42]
All right. One more. Trump must go now.

[Speaker 15]
Just here checking it out. Going to find out. I've been here as long as it's useful.

I'm contributing one number in protest.

[Speaker 37]
One person, one number.

[Nick Shirley]
Where did you come out today from? Maryland. Maryland.

Kind of a less of a showing than I thought was going to happen here today. They've been advertising this thing everywhere.

[Speaker 15]
Yeah, I thought there might be a big march.

[Nick Shirley]
Do you think the protesters are kind of feeling a little bit defeated after the No King's protest? Two of them and Trump's still in office?

[Speaker 15]
No, I think this is hopeful. I say there's about 2,000 people here. And I think the emphasis here is that it's a start.

And it's a start and it builds with a start. And you just can't back down, you can't be afraid. I love my country.

And I've been to several protests just checking them out. The country's just getting worse and worse. So I'm an old guy.

I'm contributing one number to the crowd here.

[Nick Shirley]
Good on you for being out here today. Have a great rest of your day, sir. We got Luigi out here.

Clown Luigi. What's the Luigi hat represent?

[Speaker 5]
I'm not really interested in being in your live stream. No?

[Nick Shirley]
Okay, no worries. We don't want you in it. Thank you, though.

Have a good one.

[Speaker 14]
The floor to divide us. To silence us. To strip away our most basic rights.

We need nothing less than a new anti-war movement. A movement for our rights. Our freedom.

Our very lives. The Trump regime is built on falsehoods. Fueled by lies.

And lifted straight from the fascist regime to destroy democracy. And you, every one of you here today, are part of that new anti-war movement. You are ready to stand up, speak out, and keep our democracy alive.

This is our moment to draw the line. To defend the promise of equality and freedom for all. To say no to the war on democracy.

To say no to the war on women.

[Nick Shirley]
Impeach. Convict. Remove.

[Speaker 14]
To say no to fascism.

[Nick Shirley]
Now they're saying F no to fascism on the big speaker.

[Speaker 14]
Behind Trump's agenda is a network of extremists. Years in the making with a single goal. The systemic demanding of our rights.

Project 2025 is their road map. They want to outlaw abortion. They want to demonize immigrants, including my father.

They want to overturn resistance.

[Nick Shirley]
What's the sign say? Refuse fascism. Texas says Trump must go now.

Refusefascism.org. Mobilize now. You guys coming out here from Texas today?

Wow, that's a long journey. Houston and Austin. I'm a Texas Democrat, y'all.

What do you guys think about Jasmine Crockett? She's from Texas. You like Jasmine Crockett?

She doing good for people of Texas? At the end of the day, what do you think these protests are going to be accomplishing here in America? We've seen lots of them lately.

We've seen the no kings, no kings one, no kings two. Lots of these refuse fascism protests. Do you feel like the fatigue's kind of hitting people?

The numbers are kind of low today.

[Speaker 2]
Well, it's a long ways to come all the way over here. It's expensive and people are working. It's a working day.

But as you can see, a lot of these people took time off work. They took time off school like the students are saying. And it's worth it though.

[Nick Shirley]
Do you think this organization is going to be able to uproot Trump out of office?

[Speaker 2]
It's going to grow. It's growing. This is just the beginning.

I think that what we're calling is unity. The country's divided. So we're calling for unity.

Fascism is affecting everybody. People of color. Anybody that, it doesn't matter what color they are, if they resist or they're against what they're doing, they're on the list to be eliminated.

[Nick Shirley]
To be eliminated? What do you mean by that? To be deported?

[Speaker 2]
Deported, of course.

[Nick Shirley]
Do you think they're deporting American citizens?

[Speaker 2]
Of course. Haven't you seen the news?

[Nick Shirley]
Do you know any American citizens or name anybody that have been deported?

[Speaker 2]
I'm an American citizen and I haven't been approached to be deported. But I might be, just because of my color.

[Nick Shirley]
And if they were to ask you for your documentation, would you give it to them?

[Speaker 2]
No.

[Nick Shirley]
Why wouldn't you give it to them?

[Speaker 2]
Because I'm not going to be carrying it around just to please them.

[Nick Shirley]
Like if they were to ask, hey, can we just check your ID and put it in our system, would you give it to them?

[Speaker 2]
Maybe not.

[Nick Shirley]
Maybe not.

[Speaker 2]
Because I have rights.

[Nick Shirley]
Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
I have rights. I'm going to call my attorney. Take off your mask first.

[Nick Shirley]
Yeah, do you think it's bad of ICE agents to wear the mask?

[Speaker 2]
Of course. Of course. What are they hiding?

I mean, if they're just doing their job, what are they hiding?

[Speaker 11]
Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
You know, it's been known that there's a lot of people that are posing as ICE agents.

[Nick Shirley]
Yeah, a lot of people are trying to, like, dox them. So I think that's why they wear the mask.

[Speaker 2]
Because of the mask, there's a lot of people that are out in the community stealing from people. They're, you know, just terrorizing people.

[Nick Shirley]
Oh, is that? Oh, so you think because of, like, the ICE agents wearing masks, it's enabled more people to wear masks outside?

[Speaker 2]
Of course. Of course. We've heard of stories in the communities where people have just been stopped and being asked for money.

It's like, okay, I'll let you go, but give me $300. It's like, yeah, right.

[Nick Shirley]
Really? That's crazy. So people are now dressing up as ICE agents and extorting people on the streets?

Wow, that's crazy. I wouldn't be surprised. If I was a criminal, that wouldn't be the worst tactic in the world to dress up as somebody with power or put an immigration vest on, put a mask on.

[Speaker 2]
It's happening, though. It's happening. And, you know, what really bothers me is that a lot of these immigrants, not just from Mexico or Latin America, but from all over the world, you know, they get here with a dream.

What's the first thing they do? They go get a job. It doesn't matter what job it is, you know.

They're just sweeping, working in hotels for minimum wage. They work from six, seven days a week to pay their rent, to gather some money. A lot of them are working.

And then they don't qualify for benefits. They don't qualify for benefits. You have to show you're a U.S. citizen to qualify for food stamps and all that. So, you know, it's like they don't qualify for unemployment either. A lot of them don't get overtime. So they're literally a slave group because they work for a very minimum wage, you know, no overtime, no pay, nothing.

And they still do the job that other people don't want to do.

[Nick Shirley]
Immigrants come here, they get lower paying wages. They're kind of unregulated in a way so they can put as many hours as possible, which is not cool, which you don't want to be coming to America to do. Do you think, for instance, when Joe Biden was president and he let in around 10 to 20 million illegal migrants, do you think we'd be having these problems we're having right now with immigration if we didn't let in so many people, if we went through more of a process besides just opening up the border?

[Speaker 2]
This country was built with immigrants.

[Nick Shirley]
But should we just let anybody and everybody come in?

[Speaker 2]
Well, not necessarily, you know, not necessarily. But if they're running from their country because of wars, you know, it's like, what are we going to do? And immigration is not a problem just in the U.S. It's a problem all over the world because of the wars. Look at people being sent out from Gaza, children, you know. So the countries next to them should just close the doors or kill them or what are they going to do with them? It's the same thing.

[Nick Shirley]
For instance, like a lot of migrants, they pass through lots of countries to get to the United States. Do you think there's any better options besides the United States to get to on that journey up towards the U.S. border, for instance? Like would you say Mexico is a good place, El Salvador?

Do you think that America is the only place that should be like the final destination for a lot of these migrants or do you think they should look elsewhere?

[Speaker 2]
They go elsewhere. A lot of them go to Canada. A lot of them go somewhere else.

Like people from Peru, they go to Spain, they go somewhere else looking for a better life, you know.

[Nick Shirley]
It's kind of crazy what's happening across the world as far as mass immigration from all countries.

[Speaker 2]
A lot of those people that are against immigrants, I wish they would go out to work in the fields, get up at 4 in the morning, come home at 6 o'clock, and get a paycheck of, what, $5.95, $7.95 an hour, you know, doing hard work, really hard work. I would like to take a bus full of all these people that have never done field work to work in the- I was a farm worker for 10 years. Then as an adult I got a social worker degree, okay?

And I'm a U.S. citizen. I was born in Texas. But I'm one of the fortunate people that was born here.

But I was still a migrant. I was still a farm worker. So I know the hard work, you know, bending down, picking up bushes of apples.

[Nick Shirley]
There's no doubt that immigrants do do a lot of hard work here in the United States. I think people are just kind of upset with how many people came in because you had mass immigration. Now you're going to have mass deportations, and now you're just seeing it kind of at a new level that's never really happened here.

But there's still only 500,000.

[Speaker 2]
The U.S. was formed with immigrants. All the people that came from Poland, that came from Italy, that came from everywhere.

[Nick Shirley]
That was 250 years ago.

[Speaker 2]
There were some immigrants. A lot of them didn't come with a visa or with documentation, you know. Not everybody came like that.

[Nick Shirley]
Different time, different circumstances.

[Speaker 2]
A lot of them came as slaves too. And immigrants back then formed the U.S. Immigrants right now are sustaining the U.S., you know, the hard work. If all the immigrants that are working for low pay just didn't work for a day, what do you think would happen?

Restaurants, hotels, farm work. Who would do that work?

[Nick Shirley]
Maybe they'd have to go find some unemployed Americans and fill the jobs. I don't know.

[Speaker 2]
They don't want to go. They don't want to do it.

[Nick Shirley]
Maybe they would.

[Speaker 2]
I lived in Washington State in the farms. There was no Anglos or people that were born here that wanted to go do the minimum job work. You know, a lot of farms in California are just tearing up their farms because there's no workers.

Have you worked in the field? I've worked on a farm before.

[Nick Shirley]
My grandpa has a farm. I spent some summer weeks at my grandpa's farm, belling hay and whatnot.

[Speaker 2]
Was it good?

[Nick Shirley]
It was good. It was good. It was fun.

[Speaker 2]
You did it as a vacation though.

[Nick Shirley]
I did it to spend time with my grandpa.

[Speaker 2]
Yeah, you didn't have to do it as a, you know.

[Nick Shirley]
My dad was a farm worker. My grandpa's a farm worker. He still runs a farm to this day.

[Speaker 2]
But he owns the farm.

[Nick Shirley]
Yeah.

[Speaker 2]
Okay, that's very different than...

[Nick Shirley]
My dad didn't own the farm though when he was American. Okay. So, I mean, there's different stories for different people.

I think today you're seeing different circumstances and now people are trying to use the word that, say that, well, America was built on the back of immigrants. Well, that was a different time, different circumstances. Today we have these circumstances.

And I think because we had mass immigration the past four years, now we're having mass deportations. And it's just kind of a repercussion of what happened underneath the Biden administration.

[Speaker 2]
Well, I...

[Nick Shirley]
Because I think, like, we just had unsustainable levels. So now it's like, well, we're seeing a lot of people upset with the mass immigration that happened and whatnot. There's a housing shortage here in the United States, but we also have 10, 20 million undocumented migrants.

That's also a repercussion of that stuff as well. So not that immigrants are to blame for everything or anything, but it's just something that I think a lot of people are easy to use and use that word immigrants as a way to kind of weaponize immigrants but also maybe put some blame on them as well for the mass immigration that occurred underneath the Biden administration at levels that had never been seen before. So...

But I appreciate the conversation, man. And I appreciate you for coming out all the way from Texas, ladies and gentlemen. That's quite the journey.

Well, God bless you, ma'am, and hope you have a good day here at the Capitol. This guy's getting passionate on the screen. This guy's getting passionate.

Wow, let's see what this guy's yelling about.

[Speaker 26]
For the people! By the people! Which means Trump must go!

Trump must go now! Thank you, brothers and sisters. Let's get it done!

[Nick Shirley]
How are you doing?

[Speaker 13]
My name is Haley. I'm with the Federation for American Immigration. Okay, very cool.

We're friendly. We love what you've been doing. I just wanted to get your thoughts on what you've seen today.

[Nick Shirley]
Okay.

[Speaker 13]
You've been to a couple ICE protests as well, so kind of what you're seeing.

[Nick Shirley]
Let's just move to somewhere where it's not so loud.

[Speaker 13]
Sounds good.

[Nick Shirley]
Alright, we're getting interviewed by some folks out here. One sec. Some people are saying my stream's getting a little laggy, so I just want to make sure everything's going good.

Alright, I think it's going good. We've got a lot of people just yelling at us in the microphone.

[Speaker 13]
I saw earlier you got surrounded and they were like, don't talk to us.

[Nick Shirley]
I know, it's kind of wild.

[Speaker 13]
Yeah. So, what have you seen today in regards to ICE and immigration?

[Nick Shirley]
Today, here?

[Speaker 13]
Yeah.

[Nick Shirley]
In Washington, D.C.? Yeah. I'm not seeing any ICE agents out here right now, but I've seen a lot of protesters.

[Speaker 13]
What are the protesters saying?

[Nick Shirley]
Oh, the protesters. They're upset, obviously, with what's happening. You see the signs right there.

They're saying Trump's got to go. They're saying that ICE is a modern-day gestapo. Lots of things out here today.

[Speaker 13]
Is it similar to what you've been seeing in different states?

[Nick Shirley]
Yeah, this organization. They've been advertising. I've seen their advertisements in New York City on Broadway.

I also saw them in Portland just the other week. These people have been advertising all across the country just to try to bring people here to Washington, D.C. And is the common consensus like Nazi, ICE? Look at this one.

Tyrants, dictators, dystopia, greed. They're all out here saying that Trump's a Nazi, that this is the modern-day fascism, neofascism. I've heard that word as well.

It's interesting to hear how the slogans and everything are kind of coming back. They're trying to weaponize Trump and calling him a Nazi and whatnot, which I do not believe is true.

[Speaker 13]
And you were just at the White House, right?

[Nick Shirley]
Yeah, I was there just a few weeks ago.

[Speaker 13]
How did that go? Was Trump like a nice guy, everything?

[Nick Shirley]
Yeah, it was cool. It was cool to go inside the White House. A lot of people don't get that privilege, so I was super excited to go in there and speak on what I spoke about.

[Speaker 13]
So you were also in New York City yesterday talking to people about their votes. What do you think is going to happen in New York City now that Mundani is obviously going to be the mayor?

[Nick Shirley]
It's going to be interesting to see what happens. He's promised a lot of things. I guess now we're going to have to give him a shot and see what happens in New York City.

I wish him the best, but I also think you're going to see lots and lots of changes inside New York City.

[Speaker 13]
Have you ever felt unsafe at an ICE protest?

[Nick Shirley]
Oh yeah, lots of times. These people will come after me. They throw water on me.

I've had to get pulled out of a few protests because of protesters attacking me and whatnot.

[Speaker 13]
Did I saw the sniper video? What was that?

[Nick Shirley]
Antifa tried to smoke me, essentially, he said. He came out and pushed me and took his helmet off. I was cornered up against the road, and then a sniper came and pointed it on him and luckily got me out of there.

[Speaker 13]
We love watching what you're doing. We are pro-immigration and pro-America, pro-law.

[Nick Shirley]
Nobody's against immigrants. People are against illegal immigration. We had mass immigration.

Now we have mass deportation because of the repercussions of the mass immigration that we have here in the United States. People don't get that.

[Speaker 13]
We appreciate your coverage because the media is totally skewing everything. They're only showing the bad stuff. They're not showing the murderers, the rapists, the child traffickers that are being deported.

You're really doing a fabulous job.

[Nick Shirley]
Thank you. People make the argument that immigrants do less crime than American citizens, which is true, but they're doing crimes that are unnecessary. Lakin Riley would still be alive if that guy wasn't brought in here to the United States and wasn't housed and sent to Georgia.

She'd still be here. Same with Jocelyn Nungrai. She'd still be here.

It's unnecessary crime that's happening.

[Speaker 13]
We'd love to have you on our podcast sometime if I could give you my business card.

[Nick Shirley]
Yeah, yeah.

[Speaker 13]
I want to give it up for all the volunteers.

[Nick Shirley]
Thank you so much.

[Speaker 37]
God bless you guys.

[Nick Shirley]
How's it going? I'm a huge fan. Thank you so much.

I appreciate it.

[Speaker 37]
Nice. Thank you so much. Appreciate it.

Be safe out here.

[Nick Shirley]
I will. You guys, I need a water or something. I'm parched.

[Speaker 37]
Hello, hello.

[Nick Shirley]
Do you accept cash out? I'm parched right now. What's up?

I'll take a Coke. Here, put in your cash out. We got Mark here, everybody.

He's dressed as Superman. How much is it? Five dollars for this?

Really? You sure?

[Speaker 37]
Yeah.

[Nick Shirley]
You're not upcharging me right now?

[Speaker 37]
No.

[Nick Shirley]
Five dollars? All right, I got you.

[Speaker 37]
Have a good day.

[Nick Shirley]
All right, let's talk to some more folks. They're talking about coming out here every single day. Free D.C. From what? Free D.C. from what?

[Speaker 8]
The people in D.C. don't have voting rights. Full voting rights. Did you know that?

[Nick Shirley]
Really? As a state, right? You think they should make D.C. a state?

[Speaker 8]
Yeah, I do think that.

[Nick Shirley]
That'd be interesting.

[Speaker 8]
Yeah, it would be. We're actually larger than two other states by population. You know, there's two or three about the same size.

[Nick Shirley]
Yeah, I think I've heard them talk about that, like, I don't know if it's realistically going to happen, but I've heard that, like, conversation a few times about people wanting D.C. to become a state. What would that do to the Electoral College?

[Speaker 8]
Well, that's probably one of the reasons why it's not happening very fast. Currently, today, D.C. is very liberal. Yeah.

So it would probably mean two more Democratic senators and one more representative. But historically, I mean, D.C. has been all over the place politically. If you go back 100 years, I mean, it was largely Republican, and it's really changed a lot.

So it's not a very good excuse not to give people their voting rights.

[Nick Shirley]
Do you think they should make Puerto Rico a state?

[Speaker 8]
I think that's what the people of Puerto Rico have to decide if they want to be in the state. They've never decided that. They've had referenda and have decided twice, I think, to remain the way they are.

The people of D.C. have had a referendum and voted to become a state.

[Nick Shirley]
So if you're a Washington, D.C. voter and you're voting in the election, where does that vote go to? Does it go to the District of Columbia or does it go to Maryland or to Virginia?

[Speaker 8]
Right now?

[Nick Shirley]
Yeah.

[Speaker 8]
We don't have a vote. So when you vote, it doesn't matter? We can vote for president.

[Nick Shirley]
Yeah, when you vote for president, where does that get counted to? The District of Columbia, or does it get counted in Maryland?

[Speaker 8]
Yeah, District of Columbia has an electoral area.

[Nick Shirley]
An electoral area as well? Interesting. That's just such a small area, though, Washington, D.C. Well, it's 750,000 people.

[Speaker 8]
That's as many as Alaska. It's more than North Dakota, more than South Dakota, more than Montana, more than Vermont. Why is it here to stay?

It just doesn't make sense.

[Nick Shirley]
Yeah, well, I guess we'll see what happens. I don't know if Trump's going to do it, but maybe the next Democrat president will do it.

[Speaker 8]
Who do you think is the next Democrat president? Even that's disappointing, because when Obama was president, Democrats had both houses for two years and moved very little. Moved a little bit, but not very far.

Because I think even Democrats...

[Nick Shirley]
Who do you think is the next Democrat president?

[Speaker 8]
I have no idea.

[Nick Shirley]
Do you feel like the Democrat party's kind of lost right now? It seems like Zora Mandami's like the man right now, but he can't ever be president.

[Speaker 8]
No, I don't know if he is the man. I mean, he's a good guy for New York.

[Speaker 37]
I don't know about the U.S. Yeah.

[Nick Shirley]
Who would you put right now? If you're like, we've got a Democrat president in office tomorrow, who would you choose?

[Speaker 8]
California. Newsom? Newsom is fine.

He originally was not exactly my kind of guy, but he seems to be rising to the demands of the current era. I mean, his style, his way of speaking is... I was really impressed with the way he managed this referendum.

[Nick Shirley]
Nice, nice. It looks like we've got the handmaids coming up here. Let's show everyone this.

We've got the handmaids coming up. Hey, nice speaking with you. God bless you.

Have a good day. We've got the handmaids coming through. Thank you very much, Tracy Steele, for becoming a member.

[Speaker 18]
A fascist America. A fascist America. In the name of humanity, refuse to accept a fascist America.

A fascist America.

[Speaker 11]
Trump must go down. Trump must go down.

[Speaker 26]
Now we've got some screamo here. Trump must go down. We've got a panther.

Trump must go down. What the heck is going on? We've got these old ladies fired up.

This lady is fired up right now. We've got the handmaids up there.

[Speaker 18]
We've got the handmaids up there. In the name of humanity, refuse to accept a fascist America. A fascist America.

In the name of humanity, refuse to accept a fascist America. A fascist America. In the name of humanity, refuse to accept a fascist America.

[Speaker 21]
A fascist America. A fascist America. The immigrants, he's deporting them illegally.

What else? I can't hear you. It's so loud.

Have a good day, ma'am. Well, he wants to run for the third term. The third term will be crazy, hon.

Huh? The third term will be crazy. Yeah.

But he can run as vice president and get in.

[Speaker 44]
Let's march D.C. All right, we're marching!

[Nick Shirley]
We're marching D.C. Wait, so this isn't a pro-Trump rally? All right, that's the direction, folks. So this isn't a pro-Trump rally?

Beginning to move in this direction. No, it's not? Oh my gosh.

[Speaker 18]
Trump must go now! Trump must go now!

[Speaker 44]
We need some volunteers to hold these bags up here. Volunteers, let's help us out over here, okay?

[Nick Shirley]
Oh my gosh, thank you so much. Get behind the lead banners in the front and march on!

[Speaker 39]
Let's do it!

[Nick Shirley]
Wow, thank you very much. Also, thank you Cranky Steel for becoming a member. Goated.

I hope you have a butt stick. That means a lot. Thank you so much.

Now we're marching somewhere. Whoa, we got the devil out here! The devil.

How you doing, Satan? How you doing, Satan?

[Speaker 17]
Am I insane?

[Nick Shirley]
No. How are you doing, Satan?

[Speaker 17]
Oh. Rain as long as the devil's in power. Yeah.

Hold on. Look, we got people with pictures.

[Nick Shirley]
We got Satan out here. This is a very important message you gotta give Satan.

[Speaker 17]
Satan doesn't need a lot of help. Satan just needs silence. Yeah, what makes you want to choose Satan?

Silence and complicity. Oh, I didn't choose Satan. He found me.

I'm here against my own will. I only work for the devil so I can survive. Like most of us.

[Nick Shirley]
Really? Yeah. I like to work for Jesus Christ.

What makes you want to work for the devil? Oh, this is your thing? Yeah, we just talk to people in protest.

Oh, okay. Well, I believe in Jesus Christ. So I also understand the devil also has a lot of influence as well.

What influence has the devil had on you in your life?

[Speaker 17]
So, my entire portation of the devil is a joke. I didn't realize I had to say that explicitly. But the reason why I'm doing all this is to paint a caricature of fear.

And what happens to people when an idea is inflated and when fear is used as a way of controlling you and keeping you in line. I do this as a caricature to send a message. Because something so silly can cause so much fear.

[Speaker 10]
Did you know that Satan actually wasn't in Christian mythology until very recently? You know, the Satan in the Old Testament was just a force of, like a judge in the Old Testament. And it's been so contorted with modern Christianity.

It's changed a lot since its origins. And Satan as a character is a very modern concept, actually.

[Nick Shirley]
So you don't think Satan is a historical... You don't think he was here in the beginning of time?

[Speaker 10]
No.

[Nick Shirley]
So how do you think Satan evolved to where he's at today?

[Speaker 10]
I think that it was some Mesopotamian deities. There was Baal, there was Yahweh. They were Mesopotamian deities in that area.

Yahweh was a storm god originally. And he actually... A bunch of different gods, like El.

If you know El, he referred to in the Old Testament. That is a different god from Yahweh. And the old people that put together the Old Testament actually merged a bunch of different books from a bunch of different primordial deities.

[Nick Shirley]
So do you believe there is such a thing as the devil?

[Speaker 10]
No. Because this is all made up by people.

[Nick Shirley]
Do you believe Jesus is real?

[Speaker 10]
Nope. He might have been a real person, but...

[Nick Shirley]
Do you believe there's a savior in this world or no?

[Speaker 10]
No. I think we're all individual people. Probably go back to nothing when we die.

I mean, there's no way to know that, but... Yeah, your religion is based off of other religions. And it's all just stuff people made up in the end.

Does that make sense?

[Nick Shirley]
What do you hope comes of your life, after this life? Do you hope there is a life?

[Speaker 10]
I hope that I'm happy. I hope that I form good relationships with people. And I hope that I do things I believe are ethically moral.

[Nick Shirley]
Do you believe there is an afterlife, or do you believe we just go all the way to dusk?

[Speaker 10]
I think that this is our one chance.

[Nick Shirley]
Would you like to believe that there is a chance that you may be resurrected with your loved ones again?

[Speaker 10]
No, not really. Yeah, we're kind of busy here. I just kind of wanted to get the attention off my friend here.

And I tend to info-dump about Christianity.

[Nick Shirley]
None of us are ever going to know until we go to the other side. But I'd rather have hope in another life than not.

[Speaker 13]
Just because you don't believe in the afterlife doesn't mean you don't have hope, man.

[Nick Shirley]
She said she's going to dusk. Going to dirt after this life. I'd at least like to hope for something better.

No, why would that be a good thing? What's the purpose of living a life with morals and values, if you don't believe you're going to get recompensated for the human you were on this life? What's up?

Hold it like this. I want to shake your hand. God bless you.

I will be safe. Because in reality, what's the point of living a life with high morals, doing good things, if you do not think you'll be rewarded on the other side, on the next side of this life, right? I think we're all going to reap what we sow in this life.

So hopefully, based off of your actions in this life, you'll be rewarded in the next. Or else we'd all just be living, floating around here, doing whatever we want. That's the reason why you feel good when you do something good, and you feel bad when you do something bad.

There's good and evil in this world. Where are we marching to? This is where things get interesting when we march.

Where are we marching to? We're marching. We're going to go talk to Congress.

We're going to go reopen the government. We're going to go sign a bill and get the government reopened. Look, we've got all the handmaids out here.

[Speaker 18]
What'd you say? The Trump regime has got to go.

[Nick Shirley]
The Trump regime. Dang, they trusted you a lot with that microphone. Yeah, they sure did.

I don't think they was willing to displace it. Maybe it'd take a little bit of practice. Yeah, take some practice.

Get that thing going.

[Speaker 33]
We've got a panda out here.

[Nick Shirley]
How are you doing? This guy is chanting right here. No ice, no border wall.

The Trump regime has got to fall. They do not believe in borders here. I'm feeling pretty free right now.

[Speaker 33]
What do you mean until we're free?

[Nick Shirley]
I feel pretty free right now.

[Speaker 33]
Do you not feel free right now?

[Nick Shirley]
Because they're chanting take the streets and don't go home until we're free. What are we trying to free? She says we're free.

We've got Amfifa out here. No, we're not fascists, right? We don't support fascism.

You think so? Yes, sir. How are you doing?

How are you doing, sir?

[Speaker 22]
Alright, one, two, three. Here, we'll pretend like we like each other.

[Nick Shirley]
Do you do security? You down to go fight the canal vendors on Canal Street? Don't hire my people right in front of me, bro.

In New York City? That's where I'm from. We've got to go to war on Canal Street, alright?

You down? Alright, well give me your contact info. Because I'm declaring war on Canal Street.

They attacked me last night. Okay, I got you. Taking Canal Street back.

[Speaker 39]
You've got to pay him well, Nick.

[Nick Shirley]
If he comes and takes back Canal Street with me, we'll take care of him.

[Speaker 22]
But when I come to town, I still get priority because I found him first.

[Nick Shirley]
Okay, you live in New York?

[Speaker 22]
Yeah, from Brooklyn.

[Nick Shirley]
Alright, you down to... Because they're tall and they're big. They're all from Africa.

We've got some people from Senegal there.

[Speaker 20]
That's where they stay at.

[Nick Shirley]
And we've got to take back Canal Street.

[Speaker 11]
Alright, good conversations today, Nick.

[Nick Shirley]
Lots of great conversations out here today. But not with these people in the yellow vest. Wow.

Dang, bro. I'm declaring war on Canal Street. You guys heard it first.

Last night, things got wild on Canal Street. That's all I'm going to say for right now, though. But I am taking back Canal Street.

Because all the scammers are back. They were gone for a few days, and then they all came back. Goodness gracious, we've got Amfifa.

Just a bunch of people that don't have anything else to do until Wednesday.

[Speaker 11]
Free waters?

[Nick Shirley]
Free water. We love free stuff.

[Speaker 11]
Alright, free water.

[Nick Shirley]
Trump Vans. Hashtag out now.

[Speaker 18]
The Amfifa lady.

[Nick Shirley]
Now she's dressed up as a clown.

[Speaker 18]
Good clown outfit.

[Nick Shirley]
I think this is the black lady that's always at all the protests. This lady is consistent as frick, huh? She's as consistent as it can be as frick, right?

How do you think she protests all the time?

[Speaker 34]
Oh, I can tell. You can't get me.

[Nick Shirley]
I ain't going to get you on nothing, man. This lady's always out protesting. I've seen her everywhere.

[Speaker 34]
For years, she protested for women's rights. I've seen her in photos, so yeah. She really cares.

[Nick Shirley]
Good on her. Hey, thank you very much. LAnderson3389.

We are the Charlie Keep Going Nick. May Jesus bless you. And the Superman security.

Yeah, we love Superman. Superman's lit, huh? You guys ever see the video of ICE when they're all in inflatable costumes and ICE sprayed the pepper spray inside of the inflatable?

We got the handmaids. Where's the march going to? Where are we marching to?

[Speaker 28]
The White House.

[Nick Shirley]
Alright, I'm about to take my body, my choice. What else does your thing say? Pro-woman, pro-choice.

Detrify the patriarchy. Nice. Black Lives Matter.

Do you think it's a hot take to say all lives matter?

[Speaker 35]
All lives do matter. It's just, you know, black lives are in danger. So I think that there's nothing wrong with shedding a light on a certain community sometimes.

Not everything needs a spotlight all the time.

[Nick Shirley]
Okay, I'm cool that we agree that all lives matter.

[Speaker 35]
No one said our lives don't matter. If we were out here saying only black lives matter, then that's a little nasty.

[Nick Shirley]
Yeah, exactly. I've had some people get mad at me for saying black lives matter, white lives matter, Asian lives matter, all lives matter. And they get mad and they're like, and I've had some people say white lives don't matter.

I'm like, what are you talking about?

[Speaker 38]
All lives matter. But if a certain group or a certain community, you find them being under attack more than most, then I think it is our duty as people to shine light on that.

[Nick Shirley]
How are we doing anything gotcha, ma'am? We're just having a conversation.

[Speaker 38]
Okay.

[Nick Shirley]
Yeah, they just don't like free speech. That's what their problem is.

[Speaker 38]
I don't think that's it. I don't think that's it. I think there's just a time and place for everything.

[Nick Shirley]
I agree. You have a great rest of your day.

[Speaker 38]
You too, thank you.

[Nick Shirley]
Oh, my Antifa member, Ricky Bobby. Dang it. Thank you.

Finish this water real quick. All right, we're all recharged. Here we go.

Now we're going into the protest. Where are we marching to, ma'am?

[Speaker 11]
I don't know.

[Nick Shirley]
Well, I'm here with you guys. I'm showing what's going on. You've got quite a bit of people.

You can tell them what you're here today here for.

[Speaker 11]
Oh, my God, yes.

[Nick Shirley]
But where are we marching to?

[Speaker 47]
Turn that thing off and we can have a conversation.

[Nick Shirley]
Well, I'm working right now.

[Speaker 47]
Yeah, what's the work that you're doing?

[Nick Shirley]
Yeah, we're here broadcasting, showing people what's happening here in Washington, D.C. at the Refused Fascism protests.

[Speaker 11]
That's what we're doing.

[Nick Shirley]
You have an opportunity to tell people what you're out here today, too, for as well.

[Speaker 11]
If you'd like to tell me. Yeah.

[Nick Shirley]
Do you think that's part of the problem with our current government right now?

[Speaker 47]
Oh, okay.

[Nick Shirley]
Yeah, it's all good. But could I ask you where we're marching to? Okay.

All right, looks like everyone's gathered up here. Let's see where they're going. Thank you, Stephanie, for becoming a member.

Where are we marching to today? Can you crush that? All right, everyone's stopping here.

The slide looks like they're getting direction from the police as to where we're going to be going. Yeah. What's good?

How are you doing? Saw lots of newspapers today? Yes, sir, that's what's up.

What do you think about D.C. now? Yeah. What brought you out today?

She's going to tell you not to talk to me. Just a second, just get ready for that.

[Speaker 15]
You're a good person.

[Speaker 16]
I look like a person?

[Speaker 15]
Good person, yes. I'm a writer. I work for Street Sense Media.

I'm a writer. Uh-huh. And I help a lot of homeless people out here.

Oh, great. And I'm trying to get Trump out of the White House. Yeah?

Yeah. What makes you want to get Trump out of the White House? You know, he knocked the tailored people and knocked the tents down for the homeless.

You know, yeah.

[Speaker 40]
You need to go. You need to go.

[Nick Shirley]
No kings in America since 1776. All right, everyone's gathered here now. Thank you, JP Pro.

[Speaker 11]
Appreciate you. Let's go.

[Nick Shirley]
The reason why they're out here today is because this is the one-year anniversary of Trump getting elected last year on November 5th. So this is why they're coming here to try to take over, take on the streets, show what they're out here protesting for. And it's all part of the refusefascism.org.

They're the organizers here. Now it looks like they're marching to the Capitol. Ho, ho!

All right, let's see what happens now. We're in the belly of it. What does your sign say?

Gulf of Mexico. Of the people, by the people, for the people. Amen.

We got a bowl out here.

[Speaker 24]
No, exactly. That's what they do.

[Nick Shirley]
You got it. Thank you very much. Warfighter.

Thank you very much. Watson. Appreciate it.

[Speaker 11]
All right, we made it to the front of the protest. Here they are.

[Nick Shirley]
Here in Washington, D.C. right now, you have a group of protesters. You even have the Joker out here with Trump Must Go Now. There's refusefascism.org.

It looks like their initial sign ran out, so they put another one on it. And everyone is going to be marching down to the Capitol as they're all against what's happening here in the United States, calling it the Trump regime, calling it fascist. This is a little interesting.

I don't know how many people we have out here. We got quite a bit. Here we go, everybody.

We're going into the belly, and now we're going to the belly of the beach. Here we go. We got people dancing.

What are you dressed up as? What are you? Can I touch it?

Oh, that's real right there. Dang. She's going to tell them not to talk to me.

[Speaker 18]
All right.

[Nick Shirley]
Your boss is telling you to march. All right, everybody. This sign right here says, spot the difference.

Dude, I think it's the mass kidnapper criminal. Comparing ICE to kidnappers. There isn't one, it says right here.

Do you think it's kidnapping to deport an illegal migrant? Not always. In some cases.

[Speaker 11]
Some cases.

[Speaker 22]
If you were president, what would you be doing different? I would be, instead of funding ICE with $170 billion for four years, I would have reinvested that in immigration courts and have more legal pathways for entry. I think immigrants are the backbone of this country.

[Nick Shirley]
How many illegal migrants would you let become illegal if you were president in a year? I don't have an answer. An idea?

[Speaker 22]
No. No? I have no problem with supporting illegal immigrants.

I have a problem with the conduct of ICE. Oh, okay.

[Nick Shirley]
Respectable.

[Speaker 11]
Trump must go now. Trump must go. Trump must go now.

Trump must go.

[Nick Shirley]
Trump must go now. Thank you for the Argentinian pesos. Trump must go.

Trump must go now. Trump must go.

[Speaker 37]
Trump must go now. Trump must go. Trump must go now.

Trump must go. Trump must go now.

[Speaker 11]
Trump must go. Trump must go now. Trump must go.

Trump must go now. Trump must go. Trump must go.

Trump must go now. Trump must go. Trump must go now.

We even got Deadpool out here. Trump must go now.

[Nick Shirley]
Trump must go now. Zoran! How are you feeling about Zoran winning?

[Speaker 20]
I'm so excited. What do you think happens in New York City underneath Zoran? I think it's going to be the greatest city ever.

I mean, it already is, but we're finally going to care about regular people. It's not only about the billionaires. Do you think Zoran's the face of the Democratic Party now?

He's going to be. I mean, he's more of a socialist. I think we need to reform the Democratic Party, to be honest.

So, yeah, I think he is.

[Nick Shirley]
Who do you think is the next President of the Democrats? Because Zoran can't become President.

[Speaker 20]
Maybe AOC will give it a shot. Maybe.

[Nick Shirley]
Yeah, you like AOC?

[Speaker 20]
She can be cool.

[Nick Shirley]
You know. That's going to be interesting to see what happens in New York.

[Speaker 20]
Yeah, I think it's going to be great. The whole bullshit about Sharia law, none of that's going to happen. All that Muslim propaganda is not going to happen.

So, that's just my opinion. Are you Muslim? No, no.

I'm agnostic.

[Nick Shirley]
Are you worried about like a clash between Eastern values and Western values as far as like Christian values versus values of Islam as well?

[Speaker 20]
No, I don't think so because America is a melting pot. We've co-existed for the longest time. We're going to continue to co-exist.

It was a whole smear campaign that Cuomo was running, in my opinion, of Zoran. Not very much. Yeah, no problem.

[Nick Shirley]
I personally don't have a problem with religion necessarily. Of Islam, I've met a lot of nice peaceful Muslims. I just don't want to see New York City become like a London where it doesn't even feel like the city of the people that grew that city if that makes sense as far as the You just don't want to see New York City become the next London where it's almost unrecognizable.

Wow. Where did all these people come from? There wasn't even that many people at the park.

Now it's like they've all just swarmed here into the streets. Yeah, if someone says London has been conquered, London has been conquered and that's what fears me most about what could potentially happen in a lot of our big cities here in the United States with them importing all these people and they just go there and go to the mall. Yes, I am.

[Speaker 20]
Can I take a selfie with you?

[Nick Shirley]
Yeah, yeah, of course.

[Speaker 20]
Thank you so much.

[Nick Shirley]
Yes, ma'am. Have a great rest of your day. That's what worries me the most.

Someone in the chat says the buses have arrived. Yeah, now it's filled. The streets are filled right now.

They've got a long walk and they're walking pretty slow. Wow. Let's get into the beast of it.

Here we go. So this is interesting how it's working right now. They have this megaphone, this guy on a megaphone, this girl on a megaphone and then she's leading all of the chants right now.

They're saying danger, danger. They're the fascists in the White House. It's up to them to drive them out.

This guy's giving out all three signs. Three signs. That's him.

Your crack's showing. Someone needs to lift up his pants.

[Speaker 33]
It's up to us to drive them out.

[Nick Shirley]
Wow, that's quite the seashell. Someone's got to tell them that his crack's flaring. They just keep stopping and running around.

That's going to be a long walk to the Capitol. Oh my gosh, they've got the people from Portland here. You've got the Portland chicken.

It's up to us. How'd you get here, Portland chicken? Portland chicken all the way out here.

Hi Nick. What makes you want to come out here, Portland chicken? This is a pretty monumental event, I think.

We'll see how it pans out. Good talking to you. Where's Pam at?

People all the way from Portland came out here. He's the Portland Antifa chicken. He's on the front page of the city council of Portland with them.

He's also one of the people leading the stuff that's been happening at the ICE building in Portland. Wow, people have traveled long and far today for this. Everyone's yelling stranger danger.

There's a fascist in the White House. It's up to them to drive him out.

[Speaker 11]
It's up to us to drive him out. It's up to us to drive him out.

[Nick Shirley]
We got the unicorns out here. We got Pooh Bear. We got a full on marching band out here right now.

Look at this. The marching band's here. How the heck are all these people out here on a Wednesday afternoon right now?

They got the yellow orange shirts. The marching band's out here. Quite the spectacle going on.

Thank you very much. Ambrio Brown means a lot. You guys, today we will be doing a members only live stream as well with Superman.

You can become a member by clicking here on the channel. How are you doing? You doing good?

What? What are you doing here? What are you doing here?

I'm doing What protest should I go to? Man, look at these people. I just really know what their signs are saying.

Eat the rich. Did you eat them? Did you eat the rich?

How'd it taste?

[Speaker 19]
Stale. How'd it taste? Stale.

[Nick Shirley]
Stale.

[Speaker 19]
Stale.

[Nick Shirley]
Who would be your favorite rich person to eat?

[Speaker 19]
My favorite rich person to eat? Probably Elon Musk.

[Nick Shirley]
Do you think he's a negative for society, Elon Musk?

[Speaker 19]
Yeah, I do. I do. He just uses his money and tosses it around.

[Nick Shirley]
What do you think would happen if we got rid of all billionaires here in the United States?

[Speaker 19]
I think we would have more to eat. More to eat? Yeah.

[Nick Shirley]
What do you think would happen to a lot of jobs here in the United States?

[Speaker 19]
If all the billionaires were gone? I think we would all have better wages.

[Nick Shirley]
After Elon Musk, who are you going to eat?

[Speaker 19]
After Elon Musk? I was going to say Trump, but he would taste awful. I'm not sure.

There's plenty to choose from. I'll look at the list later.

[Nick Shirley]
Do you think any billionaires helped fund some of these organizations here in the United States? Like George Soros, do you think he's a billionaire you'd want to eat?

[Speaker 19]
I'm not opposed to the idea. I mean, if he's up for it, I am. I think it's all about what it means to eat the rich.

[Nick Shirley]
Yeah. What if some of the rich people were like, oh, I'll give you a million dollars. Would you take the million dollars from a billionaire?

[Speaker 19]
Would I take a million dollars from a billionaire? Sure. I like money.

They're not going to make me do shit, but I'll take their money. They take mine.

[Nick Shirley]
So you'd like some free stuff from the billionaires?

[Speaker 19]
If they're handing it out, I'm not going to say no. But I'm not going to ask.

[Nick Shirley]
Awesome. I'll let you get back to the protest. I just thought the outfit was nice.

Your pronouns are he, him?

[Speaker 19]
That's right. Awesome.

[Nick Shirley]
What were you born?

[Speaker 19]
What was I born? Oh, I was born biologically female. Yeah.

[Nick Shirley]
How does that transition go? Do you feel like there's like, at what age did you decide you want to become he, him?

[Speaker 19]
What was that?

[Nick Shirley]
At what age did you decide you want to become he, him?

[Speaker 19]
I guess I committed to it when I was 20.

[Nick Shirley]
Oh, nice.

[Speaker 19]
Yeah.

[Nick Shirley]
Do you feel like life's more peaceful for you now or do you feel like happier now?

[Speaker 19]
I'm more content with myself, yeah.

[Nick Shirley]
Awesome. Well, I'm glad you feel that way. Thank you so much.

Absolutely. Have a great rest of your day. And you.

God bless you. I'm actually, I'm super curious like what that would be for somebody. Like that, that switch from she, her to he, him.

How does that just, is that just like something that you just wake up one day and feel or is it like a lifelong battle that a lot of people face? Interesting topic. That'd be a very interesting video to do.

Showing the transformation. She did, somebody goes in the chat, why did she start running? She did run away.

I feel like yesterday, yesterday on my Instagram, we got some weird death threats by this one person and it just happened to be a transgender. So I feel like there just has to be like some weird stuff that happens with your body. When you start putting medicine and, you know, you start playing with your hormones and stuff.

I feel like there has to be like some extremely weird things that happen. It would be interesting to do a documentary on that. Donald Trump has got you now!

[Speaker 11]
Donald Trump has got you now! Trump has got you now!

[Speaker 18]
Danger, danger, there's a fascist in the White House.

[Nick Shirley]
Now they're all chanting danger, danger, there's a fascist in the White House. Bro, this is going to take them forever to get to the White House or to the Capitol at this point. They're walking so slow.

How did you get this job today? How did you get the job of holding the signs up in the front today? It's free.

It's free? Having a good time doing it? Yeah.

Did it come with a free hoodie? Yeah, I had to buy it to him. Nice.

Watch out, he doesn't like free speech.

[Speaker 24]
No, sir, we're live.

[Nick Shirley]
This guy's leading the way up here. Shut it down! Shut it down!

[Speaker 11]
Shut it down! Shut it down! Shut it down!

Shut it down! Shut it down! Shut it down!

Shut it down! Shut it down! Shut it Shut it down!

[Speaker 33]
Shut it down! Shut it down!

[Nick Shirley]
Shut it So we're on Constitution Avenue right now, you have hundreds of protesters who have descended upon D.C., with Trump must go now, refusefashion.org is leading this protest. They're not just gonna be here today, they're going to say they're get Trump out of office and grow a movement of, they said, millions of people to try and get Trump out of office. You have signs like lifelong and see Republican against fascism.

Trump must go now. All are the same signs of Trump must go now. They all are being funded from refusefascism.org.

You also see signs such as guardians of Tito and MAGA is a cult. Fight the radical right some signs say. Yeah paparazzi out here.

I'm just calling you paparazzi. They're just taking my photos. Another paparazzi man.

Oh just what's up paparazzi? Are you? I know you from somewhere.

Maybe. Let me tell you something. What's up?

I'm undercover. You're undercover. There you go.

He's undercover right now. He's exposing the truth. He's not undercover anymore.

He just did a bad job revealing himself. You also have enjoy destroying fascism with a Bernie Sanders logo as it's written in the letters and fonts of Coca-Cola. They have a Zora Mandami voter with the F Trump hat on.

We're all just walking down Constitution Avenue right now. The way these people work is they all have a bunch of people on megaphones and so they have the megaphones spread out throughout the protest and the people the people spread out throughout the megaphones. So the people inside the protest the way these the way these two are working right now they have the megaphones spread out inside of the protests and then they have a leader up in the front reciting the chant and then everyone just starts chanting it right now and right now the chant is Trump must go now.

Meanwhile you just have some tourists that just get caught up in this crap. Imagine coming here from like Europe or something like oh we're gonna go see Washington DC. Such a beautiful place with nice buildings and then you just come across this.

Nice. How long how long does that take you to make?

[Speaker 45]
Trump getting a spanking from Uncle Sam with cartoon violence.

[Nick Shirley]
How you doing sir? How's it going?

[Speaker 17]
I'm doing the same thing you're doing.

[Nick Shirley]
Cool. Yeah. Nice.

Fire. Good luck man. Look it.

Best of luck. Have a good day bro.

[Speaker 17]
Yeah I'll be out here all day too. Nice to meet you guys as well. What?

Yeah we're live right now. Do you want a big booty Latina hat?

[Nick Shirley]
I'm alright for right now I do support the movement.

[Speaker 17]
Yeah okay.

[Nick Shirley]
Now they have this whole entire intersection blocked off. All the way to Pennsylvania Avenue it's blocked off. Geez you see the El Salvadorian flag right there.

She should go back to El Salvador. They got Bukele. Bukele.

You can live in a very peaceful country right now if you wanted to. El Salvador is safer than the United States. She should go back.

You ready for Trump to go? What brought you out here today?

[Speaker 29]
What brought me out here today? The fact that SNAP benefits are taken away from kids and families across the country. And many other things.

Government workers are not being paid. I'm a government worker. I'm not being paid.

[Nick Shirley]
What do you think the solution to it is?

[Speaker 29]
The solution to it? We need to recognize the actual needs that are going on in this country. And put our tax dollars towards what is going to actually help our citizens.

And put our tax dollars towards what is going to actually help our citizens.

[Nick Shirley]
100%. I agree.

[Speaker 29]
Healthcare, food, government work.

[Nick Shirley]
When do you think the government is going to get reopened? When do you think the government is going to get reopened?

[Speaker 29]
I don't know. I'm not optimistic about it being any time soon.

[Nick Shirley]
You think it could be another week or two?

[Speaker 29]
Yes. How are you doing? Oh, she's reading your messages.

[Nick Shirley]
My name is Nick Shirley. We're live on YouTube right now. We're talking to people.

How are you doing? What's your shirt say? What?

Now you don't want to talk? What happened? I was just looking.

Trying to figure out who you were. My name is Nick Shirley. That doesn't tell me who you are.

My name is Nick Shirley. What's your name? I'm Jessica.

Nice to meet you, Jessica. What organization are you with? With Nick Shirley.

With the organization of Nick Shirley. You don't believe me? I've never heard of it.

It's on YouTube. We have our own YouTube channel. My name is Nick Shirley.

I named the channel after me because I go everywhere. Talk to people. What are your thoughts on what's going on out here today?

Trump must go down. In what way would you like to see Trump go down? Impeach.

Convict. Remove. In what way would you like to see him get impeached?

Alien. You're right there. You're live.

[Speaker 11]
I'm just trying to help you. Do you know who he is?

[Nick Shirley]
They don't like free speech. Wow. You have a Barbie.

And Trump getting dirty on your helmet. Look at the helmet. Trump and Barbie getting dirty up there.

And the Christian right.

[Speaker 11]
Wow.

[Nick Shirley]
How long did that take you to make?

[Speaker 25]
I've been working on it since the first protest that was supposed to happen in June that didn't. Remember he threatened great force. Superman.

[Nick Shirley]
We like Superman. What are you trying to portray here with Trump and Barbie?

[Speaker 25]
That's Stormy Daniels. Stormy Daniels.

[Nick Shirley]
Trump takes a move. That's pretty funny. Should we lock him up?

[Speaker 25]
Yes, he's already locked up. Here, my little one. But yeah, he should definitely be locked up.

As Bruce Springsteen said, he's corrupt, incompetent, and treasonous. Bruce for president.

[Nick Shirley]
Who do you think is going to be the next president of the United States?

[Speaker 25]
Anybody but Trump.

[Nick Shirley]
But who do you think the Democrats will choose? We were just having a good conversation. They don't like free speech.

Who do you think would be a good candidate for the Democrats?

[Speaker 25]
I don't know.

[Nick Shirley]
We're lost right now. Who do you think is going to rise up and become that leader? Because Zoran Mandami can't become president.

I don't think he's got what it takes anyway.

[Speaker 25]
He deals to the young people.

[Nick Shirley]
You mainly just see AOC, you see Bernie Sanders, you see Gavin Newsom in the news, Jasmine Crockett. I'd vote for Bernie Sanders. You would?

Seems like his movement is going pretty strong, but he might just be a little too old by in three years to become president. How old is he? I think he's in his 80s.

[Speaker 25]
Man, that's not good.

[Nick Shirley]
Yeah. Oh no, I'm getting spread in their chats.

[Speaker 11]
See, I told you.

[Nick Shirley]
What's wrong? We're asking people who they vote for. Are you getting mad about that?

Well, God bless you. Hope you have a great rest of your day. It's crazy how people think you're just trying to do them dirty when you're asking them questions.

Watch out, Superman. Thank you very much, Connor, for that donation. I appreciate that.

Antifa, only a fascist would demonize anti-fascism.

[Speaker 28]
It's like the frog got tired.

[Nick Shirley]
Frog got sweaty. Frog's dripping right now. You have a problem with my phone?

You do? Yeah. We were having a good conversation earlier, man.

You didn't like the conversation? You didn't like when I asked you about censorship? What did he not like about our conversation?

I was talking to her earlier and she said that Trump's threatening. Now she's smacking my head. She just said she didn't mean to.

Let her do it. I don't care. Let her go.

She's harmless. They did do some math a while ago. I don't know who did it, what group did it, but it said the average group of these protesters are white, liberal women coming out here.

That's kind of what you're seeing right now. She tried to hit me with her sign. How you doing, sir?

Great. What's your sign say?

[Speaker 21]
Trump must go.

[Nick Shirley]
Oh, I like that one. It's good looking. Frog got hot.

The people united will never be defeated! The Trump fascist dream must go down. Join us in DC The people united How are you guys doing?

The people united will never be defeated! The people united will never be defeated! The people united will never be defeated!

[Speaker 11]
The people united The people united will never be defeated!

[Nick Shirley]
What are you mad about?

[Speaker 21]
We didn't have views if it wasn't for us.

[Nick Shirley]
People want to know what you guys are protesting for.

[Speaker 33]
The people united will never be defeated!

[Speaker 21]
You're not harassing her. I ain't harassing her.

[Nick Shirley]
You better not be. You better have her back.

[Speaker 21]
The people united will never be defeated!

[Nick Shirley]
How are you doing? You are in Portland! You're all over social media.

We're everywhere out here, ma'am.

[Speaker 21]
No, I mean, but you're... If you're so scary, then stay away. Like, why are you here?

[Nick Shirley]
I'm not scared of you guys. I like your shirt.

[Speaker 21]
I like that shirt. You like the shirt? Thank you, ma'am.

I like it too.

[Nick Shirley]
What does it say? Awake is the new woke.

[Speaker 21]
We are awake from woke. What does that mean? We are awake from woke.

What does that mean?

[Nick Shirley]
We're done with the wokeness. We're awake now. With all these progressive ideologies, you guys are trying to keep pushing on people.

[Speaker 38]
Where did woke come from? We don't even know where the fuck it came from.

[Nick Shirley]
Educate me, please.

[Speaker 45]
Are you willing to be educated? I don't believe it.

[Nick Shirley]
I'm right here listening to you.

[Speaker 45]
I don't believe you're willing to be educated.

[Nick Shirley]
I'll listen to you. Come here. What did she say I am?

[Speaker 4]
Are you a Trump supporter?

[Nick Shirley]
I voted for him, yeah.

[Speaker 4]
How do you feel now?

[Nick Shirley]
How do I feel now? I support what he does. I support the deportation and stuff like that.

[Speaker 4]
Are you racist? I'm not racist.

[Nick Shirley]
I love you, ma'am. Can I give you a hug? Look at this.

We love everybody.

[Speaker 45]
All I'm worried about is the racism.

[Nick Shirley]
Yeah, I ain't racist.

[Speaker 45]
You think he is?

[Nick Shirley]
I don't think he is. You don't? Uh-uh.

I don't think he is. I love you, man. I love you, too.

Do you feel like he's a racist? I don't think so. Do you think just because of the deportations or what?

[Speaker 4]
No, let's talk about the way he talks about black women. The low IQ. That's a trope for racism.

[Nick Shirley]
Has he said that before, the low IQ?

[Speaker 4]
Yes.

[Nick Shirley]
I wouldn't be surprised if he said it.

[Speaker 4]
He did. You need to follow him a little more closely. His rhetoric is so divisive.

He knows how to stir up a crowd, doesn't he? Oh my God, look at this. This is people that love their country.

This is people that love, truly love their country. I'm fighting for my country. That my people fought for years.

We've been in this fight a long time. You don't see a lot of people of color out here, but the ones that are out here, they're on their mission. He doesn't know where woke came from.

He doesn't know where the word woke came from?

[Nick Shirley]
Educate me, please, ma'am.

[Speaker 4]
He doesn't know where woke came from. You know what woke means? He twists everybody's words.

I'm going to be honest. The first time I heard woke was when Barack Obama said it. And from then on, it seemed like it was a bad word.

But it's important to stay awake. Exactly. It's the new woke.

I mean, being woke is paying attention. Do you agree? Do you agree that being woke is paying attention to what's going on?

[Nick Shirley]
I think being awake is paying attention.

[Speaker 4]
Being awake and being woke. Being awake is being woke. Awake.

If you're awake, you're open to what's going on, and you woke. It's okay to be woke.

[Nick Shirley]
I just think the things that woke stands for, like some of the ideologies and the progressiveness, is not what we want anymore.

[Speaker 4]
How do you want this to end?

[Nick Shirley]
How do I want this to end?

[Speaker 4]
How do you want all of this to end? I think there needs to be a lot more transparency.

[Nick Shirley]
I think the divisiveness, such as everyone calling Trump a fascist. I don't think he's a fascist. I don't think you can really say he is a fascist.

Stuff like that. So I think people need to see things for what it is. I think also he fires up a lot of people.

I don't think it would be a bad thing if he calmed down his rhetoric as well. Okay, so you do agree that his rhetoric is a little defensive. I know how he uses the words and whatnot, but I like Trump.

I think he does more good for the country than he does bad. And how old are you? I'm 23.

[Speaker 4]
So you weren't even old enough to vote for Barack Obama. But let me ask you, would you have voted for Barack Obama?

[Nick Shirley]
No.

[Speaker 4]
No?

[Nick Shirley]
I would have voted for Mitt Romney.

[Speaker 4]
Mitt Romney? I would have voted for McCain. I think McCain was running against Obama.

[Nick Shirley]
That was the first one, I think. I wasn't even that old when that happened. I know.

I was pretty young.

[Speaker 4]
What is your ideology for what's going on right now? How do you describe what this moment means to you?

[Nick Shirley]
Yeah, I would say a lot of these people have been bought in as far as... Peaceful, peaceful. Right now it's pretty peaceful.

You're going to see peaceful here because it's a lot of old people right here, right?

[Speaker 4]
But old people care about the country.

[Nick Shirley]
I know. But you're seeing a lot of the same demographic out here. And I'm old.

[Speaker 4]
I'm here because I'm old. I have served my time. And what I want to see is youth like yourself.

Make a more better, more positive future for everyone. I don't want my grandkids... I do have two grandkids.

I don't want them growing up thinking it's okay for somebody to grab somebody by the foot just because they can. Just because they have power. So how do you feel about those girls?

The F-15 girls. The big trucks.

[Nick Shirley]
Tragic. Very tragic. Donald Trump has his name all over that.

I want him to release the files. Oh, great. I like you.

Everyone wants him to release the files. What's your name? Nick Shirley.

Nick Shirley.

[Speaker 34]
Are you an Instagrammer? We're live right now, ma'am. Okay, that's fine.

I don't have a problem with that.

[Nick Shirley]
Yes.

[Speaker 34]
Where am I?

[Nick Shirley]
You're right here. This is a nice lady right here. Power to the people.

And I like you too. Thank you very much. For instance, I'll go up and talk to some of these people.

And they'll have one of these people in a yellow shirt say, Oh, don't talk to him because he supports Trump. Or he likes Trump. I think Trump's a good person.

I think who Trump is today, he's a good person.

[Speaker 11]
What makes him a good person?

[Nick Shirley]
I think he's put America first in a lot of aspects.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, no. You can't believe that. Argentina?

[Nick Shirley]
That was weird. I did see that. Okay.

At least you know it's weird. I think Trump cares more about America than the people that we're going against. Especially with the open borders and whatnot.

What's your name again? Nick Shirley.

[Speaker 4]
Nick Shirley from Iowa?

[Nick Shirley]
Sure. From Iowa.

[Speaker 4]
No.

[Nick Shirley]
No, not from Iowa.

[Speaker 4]
Where are you from?

[Nick Shirley]
I'm originally from Utah.

[Speaker 4]
Oh, Utah.

[Nick Shirley]
Yeah. Oh, Utah. I like Charlie Kirk.

Yeah, I think he was a good guy. And I think when we were talking about stuff that is crazy, when Charlie Kirk died, that was a very pivotal moment for a lot of people because he saw how evil the world is.

[Speaker 4]
But he's no Martin Luther King. He's no Martin Luther King. Martin Luther King tried to bring people together.

Malcolm X tried to unify black folks to stay together.

[Nick Shirley]
And I think Charlie Kirk tried to revive a lot of Christian values here in the United States, which was a good thing. I think he was definitely a net positive for society, I believe.

[Speaker 4]
They're twisting Christianity. Christianity, to me, is giving to the poor. Oh, don't be deleting.

[Nick Shirley]
No, no, no.

[Speaker 4]
Christianity is giving to the poor. Providing for the poor.

[Nick Shirley]
Yeah. I think that's important. All right, you guys.

Good conversation with that lady. Jeez, it's like they just keep getting more and more people in this thing. Let's get up to the front.

We got the Portland chicken out here. Where's Pam Tifa at?

[Speaker 11]
I haven't seen her. Jeez, how much farther do we have until we get to the Capitol building?

[Nick Shirley]
You guys, last night in New York City, I got freaking mobbed by a bunch of scammers. I had to confront all of them on my own. And NYPD had to back me up.

I was walking back to go hang out with a friend. And I had to walk through Canal Street. All the scammers recognized me.

They all recognized me. And I had like ten scammers all coming after me. And NYPD knew who I was.

And so they liked the video, obviously. Because they're trying to clean up Canal Street, too. So they were supporting me.

And it was just me against all of these scammers. Thinking I'll show it to... I'm going to work on a big documentary for it.

But for those that are members, I'm going to post it on there. So become a member if you want to see that clip. Because it was insane.

I have officially declared... Once I release that video, I have officially declared war on Canal Street. I'm taking Canal Street back.

Because you guys should have seen the disrespect that these scammers were giving to the police. They were in front of the police's faces. They were getting all mad at the police.

They were coming after me. Calling me a racist. Calling me this, that.

Saying that I'm a white trash. Everything like that. It was absolutely insane what happened on Canal Street last night.

So I'm going to release a snippet of that to the members only. So if you guys want to see that, go ahead and become a member. And you'll see that early.

Because it is absolutely insane. I had like... All the scammers were coming after me.

And then I had a lady who was a New Yorker pull up in the car. And she came out. She knew me.

She was like saying she loves me. And then I go back and the scammers... It was wild.

And it all just happened on accident. Because I had to walk through Canal Street to go to where I was going. So no one's seen that clip before.

So if you want to become a member. All you do is you click right here. And then it will give you the option to become a member.

It means a lot. Helps support the channel. I'll show you guys that clip right after this live stream.

And then we're also doing a members only live stream today as well.

[Speaker 33]
I don't speak Spanish.

[Nick Shirley]
You don't speak Spanish. So you're down to hold the sign?

[Speaker 11]
No.

[Nick Shirley]
What do you think about what's happening here in D.C. today? Do you think it's just going to get more and more people? This group that the organization is trying to curate?

[Speaker 30]
Get these assholes out of power.

[Nick Shirley]
Yeah. Who would you like to see them be replaced with? It doesn't seem like a lot of people have a name for who they want to see as the next Democrat president.

[Speaker 31]
Good question.

[Nick Shirley]
Like who do you think is the face of the Democratic Party right now? Jasmine Crockett. She's the face.

You like her? Would you like her to become the next president? Jasmine Crockett?

What about Kamala Harris though? Not ready? But you think Jasmine Crockett could be the one?

[Speaker 7]
Yeah, they're not ready for her either.

[Nick Shirley]
You got a lot of people. You have AOC. She's also Latina.

You have Jasmine Crockett, African American. You have Kamala Harris. She's Asian, half Indian, and black apparently.

So you could have a lot, three options. Yeah, a lot of people like Bernie. But how old is Bernie?

Isn't he in his 80s or something? 79 or something like that? Seems like the Democrats don't really know where they're going for right now.

Their main guy, Zoran, he actually can't become president because he's not a born citizen of the United States.

[Speaker 7]
The guy in there now, kind of wandering around, he looks like he's in bad shape.

[Nick Shirley]
You think Trump's in bad shape? Looks like it. Really?

Wow, this is quite the group we got out here today. Big march from everybody. Where did you come out today from?

Chicago. Chicago? You came all the way from...

How long are you going to plan on being here in DC for? Just a little bit. Just a little bit.

And you want Jasmine Crockett.

[Speaker 7]
Anybody else. What would you do different?

[Nick Shirley]
What's been your biggest flaw with Trump in his second term?

[Speaker 31]
The whole no due process thing. That's pretty nasty.

[Nick Shirley]
With the illegals?

[Speaker 31]
Well, it seems like it.

[Nick Shirley]
I think we could do better. Interesting.

[Speaker 31]
We've got to do better.

[Nick Shirley]
Would you deport illegal migrants if you were president?

[Speaker 31]
They need to go through the system. They need to fix that system. We need the workers.

And we need them to be here legally.

[Nick Shirley]
Do you think we had enough workers before Biden and Trump's first term that the country was doing good? Or do you think we needed to bring in 10 to 20 million more?

[Speaker 15]
I don't know. I don't follow the statistics. But I know there's a lot of work not getting done.

[Nick Shirley]
They've got to reopen the government. That's for sure, right?

[Speaker 35]
That's a good place to start.

[Nick Shirley]
Good place to start. God bless you, man. Have a good day.

I'm declaring war on Canal Street. I'm taking that street back by myself. If I have to.

I'm going to gather up the Avengers of YouTube. We're going to take back Canal Street. Jeez, how long?

How many stops? What's going on? How many stops do they keep making out here?

I don't know, I'm getting tired watching them. I know, they just keep going and stopping and then they keep going and stopping.

[Speaker 40]
The weather's nice. Where are they going now, you think?

[Nick Shirley]
I don't know. They all have the same signs. This is quite the organization out here.

They're saying this isn't made protesting. I've seen so many people. One guy nearly got tackled earlier on this live stream for talking with me.

Some organizers were like, get out of here, don't talk to him. Crazy.

[Speaker 8]
You've been working out, by the way? Always. I don't know, shirts are getting tiny.

[Nick Shirley]
This one's a little... This is an extra large right here. This is for the subscribers to go cop their new Awakens and new woke shirts.

Some lady's like, do you know where woke comes from? I'm like, what do you mean where did woke come from? I don't know.

[Speaker 8]
The English language.

[Nick Shirley]
The English language, exactly. Everyone wants these crazy definitions. They don't even know what fascist means.

[Speaker 11]
It's a big word, a lot of syllables.

[Nick Shirley]
A lot of syllables for them. This lady was mad at me for being here. What do you call those scarves they wear?

The kefifa? How are you guys doing? Why were you mad at me?

Yeah, and so come talk to me. Waste of your time? Oh.

Defend the Gestapo. Join ICE today, she says. Why do you think that ICE is a Gestapo?

[Speaker 43]
They are trafficking children.

[Nick Shirley]
Who's trafficking children?

[Speaker 43]
The United States government.

[Nick Shirley]
What about all the people that got trafficked over the border?

[Speaker 43]
It wasn't okay then either.

[Nick Shirley]
Yeah, it wasn't okay, but they're not trafficking people now.

[Speaker 43]
Yes, they are.

[Nick Shirley]
How?

[Speaker 43]
We're watching them. We document them in Los Angeles, leaving in vans, children in shackles, being taken to privatized detention centers to be profited off of.

[Nick Shirley]
With their parents?

[Speaker 43]
No.

[Nick Shirley]
No parents? No parents.

[Speaker 44]
Children by themselves. Yeah, are you okay with that?

[Nick Shirley]
I'm not okay with that.

[Speaker 39]
Okay, then good. Two of my cousins were taken three days ago while working with a mechanic. While working.

No priors. They're just immigrants in the land that was once theirs.

[Nick Shirley]
Are they legal immigrants or illegal immigrants? And you're wearing an El Salvadorian flag.

[Speaker 39]
This is my blood.

[Nick Shirley]
This is my blood. I was never a United States citizen.

[Speaker 46]
What do you say about what the land was stolen?

[Speaker 36]
You're not going to try to pull a Charlie Kirk out of here.

[Nick Shirley]
I'm not trying to.

[Speaker 36]
Yes, you are.

[Nick Shirley]
How am I talking to you in a circle? She's saying El Salvador was part of the United States.

[Speaker 36]
No, she did not.

[Nick Shirley]
You said your land.

[Speaker 46]
Our native as well. This is mine before you. Remember that.

You colonized us.

[Nick Shirley]
You were born before me, yes.

[Speaker 46]
You colonized us. You colonized us.

[Speaker 12]
We got a Nazi.

[Speaker 46]
We got a Nazi. Shame.

[Speaker 6]
Shame.

[Nick Shirley]
Shame. Shame. You're not going to try to pull a Charlie Kirk out of here.

[Speaker 33]
Shame.

[Nick Shirley]
Shame.

[Speaker 36]
They are trafficking children. They are taking 40 million people off of their assistance for food. Children are the second largest recipient of SNAP benefits.

[Nick Shirley]
I never said that.

[Speaker 39]
So you're not in an area. Why aren't you with us?

[Nick Shirley]
I'm here right now with you guys. I'm talking with you guys about what you guys are doing out here today. That's what we do.

[Speaker 12]
Yeah, okay, so you want to know you're not in the area. That's being a walk with me.

[Nick Shirley]
Where are you from?

[Speaker 12]
Okay With my own eyes children in handcuffs and shackles being marched into that building into a private prison Whose car was rammed into by ice and they took her 10-month-old baby. You're okay with that. I'm not okay with that Okay, so what's the issue?

Because we're having all these conversations about what's fascism. What's not fascism if you're not here legally, it doesn't matter Are you you don't think it matters if someone's being taken by masked men who refuse to identify themselves?

[Nick Shirley]
You don't think they're a masked person.

[Speaker 12]
You don't think they're matching them with the parents If a masked person walked up to you right now and tried to put you in handcuffs, would you go willingly?

[Nick Shirley]
If he was a law enforcement officer, I would obey You can't confirm or deny that.

[Speaker 12]
If a masked person walked up to you right now If he walks up to you right now and tries to put handcuffs on you I'm a large guy You don't have any of that stuff on you Yes or no, it's a simple answer Yes or no, are you going to go willingly? If I tried to arrest you right now, are you going to resist? Of course, because you're not a police officer Exactly, so you just made my point Yeah, you didn't make your point at all Running around out here Who are not confirmed law enforcement Why would they identify themselves?

Are being kidnapped? They have their badge numbers right there There are no badge numbers There are literally secret police running around in Los Angeles right now S.R.T. means No Distinction And you don't think they have the permission?

[Nick Shirley]
Why don't the cars have license plates?

[Speaker 14]
People are getting docked Why don't you take me to the street?

[Nick Shirley]
