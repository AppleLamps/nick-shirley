[Nick Shirley]
We're outside of a place where a deportation took place. What do you think about the current state of America?

[Speaker 3]
Because we have not had assimilation with this immigration, it's just really become an invasion.

[Speaker 7]
Why is my son wanting to learn how to load up a silencer? Because you're hurting people. No.

[Speaker 2]
So you've got the hardcore left wings that just aren't happy with anything. And it's quite frankly, it scares me.

[Nick Shirley]
What do you think about the current state of America, sir? Goodbye, fascists. What makes me a fascist, sir?

And how do you feel like Trump's second term has gone so far? Today, we're going all across America, asking Americans about the current state of America. Right now, you have lots of things going on within the nation, from ICE raids, to the rise of Islam, to Republicans turning on MAGA, and also Democrats calling Republicans fascists and Nazis.

And you even have national guardsmen who have been killed by illegal migrants on the streets of Washington, D.C. And right now within the Democrat Party, no one really knows who their leader really is. On Polly Market right now, as far as who's going to be the next nominee, it goes from Gavin Newsom to AOC. A lot of people wonder what's the current state of the Democrats as well.

But today, we're going to be going all across the country, from New York City all the way to Hawaii. We're going to be asking people about the current state of America. Let's get into it.

And let's start here on the streets of New York City. Let's go. And what do you think about the current state of America right now?

I think it's a mess. And why do you think it's a mess?

[Speaker 16]
Because we have an idiot for president.

[Nick Shirley]
Would you consider Trump a fascist?

[Speaker 16]
Absolutely.

[Nick Shirley]
And what makes him a fascist in your opinion?

[Speaker 16]
He's killing people in Venezuela without any reason.

[Nick Shirley]
Do you think we should push for a regime change in Venezuela?

[Speaker 16]
I don't really know much about the... I can't make an opinion on that. I don't really understand the Venezuelan thing.

All I know is he's just... Without Congress's approval, he's killing people.

[Nick Shirley]
And who do you think is the face of the Democrat Party right now?

[Speaker 16]
I would say Hakeem Jeffries.

[Nick Shirley]
And who do you think will be the next president here in the United States? Between JD Vance and potentially Gavin Newsom right now. Who do you think is going to win?

[Speaker 16]
I would vote for Gavin Newsom, obviously.

[Nick Shirley]
And what do you think about...

[Speaker 16]
And J.P. Pritzker.

[Nick Shirley]
Should Trump be using the National Guard to protect the United States in cities like Chicago? No.

[Speaker 16]
The National Guard are to defend the borders, not to defend the citizens.

[Speaker 19]
What do you think about the current state of America? Not ideal. What would you do to fix it?

Dismantle the federal government. And right now between the Republicans and Democrats, who do you trust more? Neither.

[Speaker 18]
Traditionally, Republicans used to want to dismantle the federal government more. Although now I think they just redo it towards military spending. I think the best solution would be like a libertarian-type solution.

[Speaker 19]
But, you know, they're not very popular. What do you think about the current state of America?

[Speaker 10]
It's awful.

[Nick Shirley]
Why do you think it's so awful?

[Speaker 10]
Because you'd think we'd be in a more progressive era. But, like, we're not. We're, like, regressing.

Like, we're going back.

[Nick Shirley]
Do you think we should be more progressive with some of our policies here in the United States?

[Speaker 10]
A thousand percent.

[Nick Shirley]
For instance, should we be deporting illegal migrants?

[Speaker 10]
No.

[Nick Shirley]
And what should we do? It's a big topic right now. For instance, we're just a few blocks away from Canal Street where lots of raids have taken place.

What should we do with people who are coming to the country illegally?

[Speaker 10]
I think we have bigger issues to worry about. You know, we do have a really bad homeless crisis. I work in criminal court, actually.

The majority of people that are getting arrested are American citizens and people that are, like, getting arrested for, like, petty larcenies. You know, which is just, like, they're stealing toilet paper because they don't have the money to pay for it. Or, like, food.

[Nick Shirley]
So I don't think that's a— So should we allow petty crime to just go by?

[Speaker 10]
I think there's something that needs to be done. There's clearly an underlining issue.

[Nick Shirley]
And here in New York City, do you think people should have more hope now that Zoran Mondami has been elected?

[Speaker 10]
I would like to think so. But I'm big on, you know, actions speak louder than words. So let's just hope he does something.

[Nick Shirley]
And what do you think about Zoran Mondami's meeting with President Trump? They seem pretty friendly.

[Speaker 10]
I mean, he has to keep it cute, you know? It's politics. Obviously, our president can't do so.

But we have to keep it cute.

[Nick Shirley]
Just the other day here in New York City, an ice raid took place here on Canal Street. Right now, you have a group of people protesting. Let's see what they have to say about the current state of America.

What do you guys think about the current state of America?

[Speaker 3]
Where are you all from?

[Nick Shirley]
My name's Nick Shirley. So what do you guys think about the current state of America right now? We're outside of a place where a deportation took place.

What do you think about the current state of America?

[Speaker 9]
I think it's pretty bad.

[Speaker 23]
Find out who they are before you talk to them. What's y'all's credential?

[Speaker 4]
Okay, so you're aware and you're actively consenting to the conversation.

[Nick Shirley]
Wow, we're just asking about the current state of America. Wow, this is unbelievable, everybody. I just wanted to come ask about the current state of America.

[Speaker 21]
We don't want to give them content that they will chop up and try to ridicule you with.

[Nick Shirley]
Can you show me your badge of journalism? They're all asking for mine.

[Speaker 21]
No.

[Nick Shirley]
Can you show me your badge of credibility?

[Speaker 10]
No, I'm not going to show you my press badge.

[Nick Shirley]
So why would they get mad at me for not having a press badge asking people, meanwhile, you're out here taking photos of me?

[Speaker 8]
I don't know. Do they know who you are?

[Nick Shirley]
They apparently do. Look at her.

[Speaker 8]
Well, that answers your question, doesn't it?

[Nick Shirley]
But I would like to know who you are as you're taking my photos.

[Speaker 8]
You don't need to know who I am.

[Speaker 23]
I don't want to be on camera and I don't want to talk to you.

[Nick Shirley]
You guys, fun fact, under the First Amendment, you have the freedom of the press, freedom of speech. You actually don't need a press badge to show up to a location and ask people questions. What do you think about the current state of America, sir?

Goodbye, fascist. What makes me a fascist, sir? All right, you guys, this is quite unbelievable here.

This is quite a little protest you got. And this just goes to highlight what's going on here in America. Let's go to the next location.

What do you think about the current state of America?

[Speaker 24]
Oh, not that great.

[Nick Shirley]
Anything you'd do different?

[Speaker 24]
Elect a new president.

[Nick Shirley]
Who do you think will be the next president?

[Speaker 24]
Um, Newsom.

[Nick Shirley]
Would you say he's the face of the Democratic Party right now?

[Speaker 24]
Yeah.

[Speaker 7]
What do you guys think about the current state of America? I think we feel like the masses need to understand that there's no left or right wing party. We need to stay in the middle and move forward.

And it's up that we're all here, including me. All this stuff needs to stop. Then the fake propaganda got big and got people dying over agendas and all this shit.

So it's not even about money anymore. It's about whoever the fuck is controlling the narrative. They need to stop.

And then now you got the people getting involved. Now the people are making their own deep state. So like, stop.

Now you got people, kids wanting to join militia. Stop. No.

Why is my son wanting to learn how to load up a silencer? Because you're hurting people. No.

No. This is crazy. Now you're like opening the gates of darkness.

[Nick Shirley]
So even young kids are trying to learn how to use guns in case something does happen. Yes. Protect their families, brother.

And given the two options of keeping all illegal migrants or deporting all illegal migrants, what would you do? Keep them or deport them all?

[Speaker 21]
I'd say keep the good ones and I'd say probably take back the criminals.

[Nick Shirley]
You have to choose. Keep them all or deport them all. What would you do?

Some of them built this country. So I have to say keep them all because I come from a first immigration family. And now we're here in Washington, D.C. We're all suited up. I got a special surprise for you guys in just a moment. But let's go interview some people here on the streets of Washington, D.C. first. How do you feel about the current state of America?

[Speaker 3]
I feel really, really good about it, Nick. I think the media tries to portray the state of our nation as a very bleak and dismal thing. But overall, I think Americans, maybe silently, are feeling a lot better than they did when Joe Biden was the president.

I mean, you look at what the media is complaining about. If the worst they can come up with is that we're blowing up Venezuelan drug boats, then I think the president's doing a pretty good job.

[Nick Shirley]
And here just a few days ago, a few weeks ago, a National Guard man was killed here on the streets of Washington, D.C. Do you feel like the media has now twisted so many words and has almost brainwashed people in the sense where they think that a National Guard man is a fascist or a Nazi for protecting the streets of Washington, D.C.? Oh, absolutely.

[Speaker 3]
I mean, the only thing you hear about the National Guard from the media is that they are the Gestapo, Trump's Nazi police. But in reality, they are the nicest people on the planet. I say hi to them every time I see them.

They wave. They smile. They're very neighborly.

They would not harm a fly. So the fact that the media has portrayed them to be some vicious, villainous creatures to the point where somebody thought that they needed to take a shot at one of them and ultimately killed one is just atrocious. And I hope the media stops with that narrative because it's not helping anybody.

They're doing a terrific job. And I feel a lot safer as a D.C. resident with them here.

[Nick Shirley]
And it's now came out that he was an illegal migrant from Afghanistan. Now Trump's calling for reverse migration here in the United States. Do you support reverse migration?

[Speaker 3]
Yes, I support it. I think because we have not had assimilation with this immigration, it's just really become an invasion. And until you have assimilation and these immigrants coming in that respect this country and respect the people living here and don't hate us, then it's never going to work out.

It's a recipe for disaster. So until we can fix this system that has become so broken, until it can heal, I'm 1,000 percent with the president. We love our immigrants.

But what Joe Biden did to this nation has made the process a total disaster. So I think that we should pause, fix, and then reevaluate.

[Nick Shirley]
How do you feel about the current state of America right now here in the nation's capital?

[Speaker 6]
It's a tragedy, but, you know, it's for the best. I mean, what do you mean? Like, what's the current state of America like?

Do we mean like, you know, the working class man just getting pulled over because he doesn't have papers and getting snatched up and sent back to El Salvador? I mean, you know, it's unfortunate. But if you look back at American politics...

Hey, shut up for a minute. Democrats have been like, generally speaking, against immigration. Bill Clinton signed a lot of bills that went against immigration.

And it's now the Democratic rhetoric to say that we are for illegal immigration because Donald Trump's against it. There's no longer a Democratic... There's no really a political environment.

It's either Donald Trump or anti-Trump. And it's kind of weird as cohorts are starting to fall out of politics just based off of his politics. And, you know, it's f***ed up.

Do you like what President Trump's doing right now?

[Speaker 12]
Some stuff I do agree with, some stuff I don't. A lot of the things I don't agree with, but... What's some of the stuff you do agree with?

As far as like, maybe like the government assistance stuff. A lot of people do need to get off their asses and work and work for what they want and what they need instead of living off the government forever. I mean, I do believe it's a crutch to certain people because they just...

They're comfortable, you know? They get too comfortable. So yeah, get assistance to help you build and get off of it.

[Nick Shirley]
And do you think the government shutdown is a wake-up call for a lot of people as far as realizing that, oh, maybe you shouldn't rely so much on the government?

[Speaker 12]
I don't... I think they think it's a joke. I don't think that it's a reality check for them.

[Nick Shirley]
When we were just talking to this lady over here, and she was actually happy that now Trump and his administration are getting rid of benefits for people who have been on them for so long.

[Speaker 17]
I don't agree. I don't agree. No matter how long somebody is on financial help, they're on it for a reason.

Everybody needs help. This economy is f***ing high. It's terrible.

So if people need that to live, then that should be accepted.

[Nick Shirley]
How do you guys feel about the current state of America?

[Speaker 14]
I think we're on path. We're obviously MAGA fans, and I think it's... Daddy's back home.

It's time to bring everyone back and move forward.

[Nick Shirley]
Seems like a lot of people are angry at President Trump right now for blowing up narco boats on the coast and for deporting illegal migrants. What's your message to them?

[Speaker 14]
Let them be angry. They voted. They lost.

Move away. By the way, if they're such nice people, invite them over for dinner. Have them live with you for a month.

[Nick Shirley]
Why do you think liberals and Democrats are so supportive of illegal migrants? And what do you think... What does the word illegal mean to you?

[Speaker 14]
Well, first of all, you're breaking the law, so you are an illegal. Secondly, it's for votes and for representation and House of Representatives and Congress, and also for cheap labor.

[Nick Shirley]
Donald Trump just called Tim Walz seriously retarded. Do you think Tim Walz is seriously retarded?

[Speaker 14]
Well, I grew up in Minnesota. That's why I'm in Vegas, and I agree with him.

[Nick Shirley]
And today, in this video, we're even inside the White House. I hope you all have a merry, merry Christmas. What do you think about the current state of America?

We're inside the White House right now.

[Speaker 9]
Okay, so I have to say the right thing inside the White House.

[Nick Shirley]
Whatever you want to say.

[Speaker 9]
No, listen, I wouldn't have taken the time to get on a plane to come here if I wasn't so proud of where we are as a country right now. Honestly, I knew it'd be good when he won, the right person won the election a year ago, but I had no idea it would look like this, and he would have made so much progress to make us a better, greater, safer country. It is an honor to be in here because of the man who's leading the way.

[Nick Shirley]
A lot of people are in uproar about the illegal migration. Now Trump's calling for reverse migration. Do you think it's a good thing to be deporting illegal migrants?

[Speaker 9]
Do I think it's a good thing to be deporting illegal migrants? Yes, the key word is illegal. And if you come in here legally, America is the most welcoming country on the face of the Earth.

Legal is the key word.

[Nick Shirley]
What do you think about the current state of America?

[Speaker 11]
Well, being from San Diego, we're absolutely loving it. You know, we have a big immigration problem down there, and the fact that we're tightening up the borders and getting things straightened out there, and number two, the economy, the economy is a lot more on fire. It was so stagnated for such a long time that we're really happy to see that going on.

[Nick Shirley]
Is there anything you'd be doing different than what President Trump is doing right now?

[Speaker 11]
I would work harder with the states on deregulation because that's where we're getting hung up on, especially with the AI boom in the data centers, nuclear power, we need to get that. We have states that we're from, like California, that are extremely regulated and it really restricts business.

[Nick Shirley]
We're now in the middle of America at a gas station. We're making our way across America. What's your current take on the current state of America?

[Speaker 2]
We've got some trouble with our politics as far as, you know, with the people on the left that it seems like they're just not happy with no matter what President Trump does, what the current political regime does. They're always mad about something and I personally think it's just, they just want to overthrow the current government as it stands. You've got the hardcore left wings that just aren't happy with anything and it's quite frankly, it scares me.

[Nick Shirley]
You got quite some years on me. What do you think about the youth nowadays, especially the people inside of these college and these big institutions?

[Speaker 2]
Quite some years, okay. Well, it's, you know, you look at some of these politicians, what do they call them, the seditious six that they just started telling service members that to disobey orders and that. It's like, you know, they didn't do that when President Obama was drone bombing places over in the Middle East.

They didn't do that when Biden was doing the same thing. We're just at a thing where no matter what this president does, no matter what this current administration does, they don't like it. They want to overthrow it.

To me, that's classic signs of a possible communist takeover. Look at all the people that are getting elected in the cities now. This is, we've got to wake up and pay attention where we're going.

[Nick Shirley]
Do you feel like Trump's doing a good job?

[Speaker 2]
I think he's doing a great job and it's unfortunate that every time he tries to do something that is productive for this country, you've got the other party just trying to hamstring them no matter what and they're doing it simply because it's Trump. And look at the price of gas I just paid. Six months, a year ago, I was paying almost double this when I'm making these trips, especially when I'm in Chicago.

Price of food's down. Everything, our security is much better. Our homeland is much safer.

And I just don't understand why people on the other side aren't sharing that and aren't supporting him for that.

[Nick Shirley]
Now we have made it all the way here to Chicago. We're going to start talking to some of the people here about what they have to say about the current situation in Chicago. Chicago's been the headlines of news for quite some time now.

J.P. Pritzker and everything from ICE, National Guard. We're going to talk to some people here that really live in here and see what it's like here in the streets of Chicago. Lots of things are happening here in Chicago.

You've got J.P. Pritzker as the governor, Mayor Brandon Johnson. They're trying to send in the National Guard and whatnot. But what's really happening here in the streets of Chicago?

She is Chicago, just Chicago and she, I mean. And what's your take on what's happening here inside the United States with the National Guard, ICE, everything that's happening here inside of Chicago and across the nation?

[Speaker 5]
Shit, bro, I ain't even seen they ass yet, for real, for real. I ain't trying to run into them, for real. I'm just living.

Get through this shit day by day. Like a lot of times I don't even be really seeing that shit. I come across it.

You know, I always look into it a little bit, but lately I've been just, you know, moving around and shit. So I ain't seen no National Guards yet, though. They probably is up here, though, you know?

Is Chicago as dangerous as they make it out to be? I mean, it's, it's motherfucking dangerous, but it's a lot of, it's a lot of most cities dangerous, too. You know what I'm saying?

Like, it's just Chicago fake like the motherland for all this shit. What would make Chicago a better and safer place? Shit, more money through this, bitch.

It's money out here, but it's like, motherfucking need more opportunities to make money. You know what I'm saying? Like, and that minimum wage need to go up a little bit more, too.

They always take that motherfucking up, pretending to take tax out that shit. So it's like, it's never even really going up. That bitch go up $24 an hour.

Now they take a damn that nick out your shit. Like, you know, it's like, so basically that shit's still the same. I don't know.

Stop taking so much tax out, motherfuckers. Check and all that shit.

[Nick Shirley]
So here in the United States, we have a big issue with immigration. Would you rather have the United States keep all illegal migrants or deport all illegal migrants?

[Speaker 22]
Man, deport they ass. I mean, somewhat, somewhat. I keep some of them and some of them I send them about their way.

[Nick Shirley]
But you have to either keep them all or deport them all. What are you doing? Shit, I'm deporting them.

All right, now we're moving on to the next city. We're out of Chicago. Now we've made it all the way here to Hawaii.

We've gone all the way from New York City to Hawaii. Hawaii is the most expensive and most unaffordable state in all of America, with the average home here being more expensive than anywhere else in America. Let's talk to the Lions about what they think about the current state of America.

How do you feel about the current state of America right now?

[Speaker 15]
We need help, major help. Because there's a lot of us people, poor people that are out on the streets right now. Can't afford homes, can't even afford rents because it's up.

Or either they sell it out, sell homes so expensive to outsiders.

[Nick Shirley]
So here in Hawaii with affordability, a lot of the affordability comes from outsiders from the mainland coming here and buying on the island.

[Speaker 15]
Besides the outsiders, even foreign countries. So not only in the U.S. How do you feel about the current state of America?

[Nick Shirley]
Here in Hawaii, you guys have the most expensive state to live in in the United States.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, it's a tough position for us because we are a part of the United States, you know, and that's something that we were obviously not, nothing that we wanted to be a part of from the beginning. You know, like being overthrown back in like 1893 and like having to be a part of the United States. Even though that wasn't our choice, we've kind of just been sucked into everything that goes on there, right?

The choices that they make affects us. And we just live in this little island and everything, of course, obviously comes in. And it's just an unfortunate situation.

I mean, everyone's just, I think you come to Hawaii and you think everyone's living this luxury, like paradise life. And it's really not. I just moved back from Utah about three years ago and it's like a rat race.

It's like everyone's working like seven days a week to survive. You know, it's just like nonstop and it's gas. I feel like I put gas like at least three times a week.

It's just like nonstop food prices and everything.

[Nick Shirley]
In Donald Trump's second term, how do you feel he's doing? And has he made any changes that have affected the lives of people here in Hawaii?

[Speaker 4]
Well, see, I voted for Trump. Like I was really like, okay, Trump's going to come back and he's going to like get everybody working again and like things are going to be better. And then the opposite has just happened.

It's just, I don't know where he's going. I don't know what his agenda is with all this. I think he's listening to a lot of, you know, big players in there who think that they have an idea of what to do.

But I don't know. I don't know. It's kind of a scary situation.

[Nick Shirley]
How do you feel about the current state of America?

[Speaker 13]
A rough shape, I feel financially and physically.

[Nick Shirley]
And what do you think about Trump's second term so far?

[Speaker 13]
It's been a rough start. One year feels like three years already.

[Nick Shirley]
The topic of inflation and affordability is coming up a lot right now. Here in Hawaii, it is the most unaffordable state in America. How are people getting by?

[Speaker 13]
One day at a time. Honestly, it's a daily struggle.

[Nick Shirley]
How many people from Hawaii are just living paycheck to paycheck, would you say?

[Speaker 13]
I'd say every one of them. These days right now, it seems like everybody's living paycheck to paycheck. I mean, you're one medical episode away from being broke.

[Nick Shirley]
So would you say most Hawaiians are one paycheck away from technically being on the streets?

[Speaker 13]
Yeah, one major event. Major life event, for sure.

[Nick Shirley]
In 2028, right now on Plymarket, it says J.D. Vance projected to win the presidential election and then Gavin Newsom underneath that. Who do you think will actually win the election in 2028? A Republican or a Democrat?

[Speaker 13]
I feel since everything's trending down for Trump right now, that it will be a Democrat.

[Nick Shirley]
And has anything Trump's done in this second term affected you?

[Speaker 20]
No, they're nothing for us. Pretty much, yeah.

[Nick Shirley]
Do you think the United States should be supporting people here that came here illegally? Should it be giving welfare to people, for instance, in Minnesota, where they're giving people from Somalia, refugees, money who are on welfare?

[Speaker 20]
Us Americans, instead of the outsiders. That's how I look at it.

[Nick Shirley]
Should welfare even be going to people who are refugees, immigrants, whatever you want to call them?

[Speaker 20]
No, I don't think so. It should be supporting us Americans. They don't get everything, not us, you know what I mean?

[Nick Shirley]
And how do you survive here in Hawaii? Fishing, whatever we can do. And how do you feel like Trump's second term has gone so far?

[Speaker 8]
Well, he's not sitting on his laurels, that's for sure.

[Nick Shirley]
On his what?

[Speaker 8]
Laurels.

[Nick Shirley]
Laurels, what do you mean by that?

[Speaker 8]
He's not just sitting down and looking pretty. He's actually doing something, making noise. He's trying to do it on a global scale that does impact America.

So to me, he's doing something that no other president has done as far as, you know, tariffs and ICE and all that. So yeah, it's a change.

[Nick Shirley]
And what do you guys think about when you see the ICE immigration and the deportations and the raids taking place in the United States on the mainland?

[Speaker 8]
My simplest term I can understand is get documented. That's it. Just get documented.

That's all the beef is about. Really do the paperwork.

[Nick Shirley]
And if someone's here illegally, should they be mad when they get deported out of the United States? No. Hell no.

[Speaker 8]
No.

[Nick Shirley]
Someone on FaceTime goes, oh hell no.

[Speaker 25]
No.
