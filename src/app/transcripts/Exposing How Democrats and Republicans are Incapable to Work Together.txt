[Nick Shirley]
Senator, what will it take for you to vote to reopen the government?

[Speaker 13]
It's all in the Republicans. Shame!

[Nick Shirley]
In simplest terms for the American people, can you explain why the government is shut down?

[Speaker 13]
So next month, I won't receive food stamps.

[Nick Shirley]
Hello, is AOC in today? The United States government has been shut down for a record amount of days. This is the largest shutdown in the United States history.

And today we're here at the nation's capital, talking to people about the shutdown, why it's shut down. A lot of people are being affected from the shutdown. Government workers are not being paid.

SNAP benefits have been cut nearly in half. And now airplanes are going to be flying at 10% less than usual here in the United States because of this government shutdown. Right now, Republicans are blaming Democrats, while Democrats are blaming Republicans.

And so today we're gonna be speaking with all sorts of people, from congressmen to congresswomen, to protesters, to people on the streets, to people losing their benefits from SNAP and everything in between. Today we're going to see what's happening and get the truth about the government shutdown. Here we are here at the U.S. Capitol. And so right now you have some Democrats outside of the Capitol building. Right now they're doing a press conference and they're blaming the government shutdown on Donald Trump. And their signs say, Stop healthcare heist.

Billionaires got richer. Americans get sicker. So they're blaming the shutdown on President Trump.

And if Democrats and Republicans don't come to agreements right now, what's going to happen is premiums are going to go up. What Donald Trump is saying is that they need to pass whatever they're trying to pass, and then they'll talk and they'll be able to negotiate it out. But Democrats want to keep the Affordable Care Act, Obamacare in place before premiums do go up on Americans.

In simplest terms for the American people, can you explain why the government is shut down?

[Speaker 17]
Because Mike Johnson won't negotiate, and John Thune won't negotiate, and Trump won't allow us to save healthcare for the American people.

[Nick Shirley]
Look, right now we have some people getting angry at you. Are you a Republican or Democrat, sir? I'm a Republican.

Look, right now we have some people yelling at right now because of the current state of government.

[Speaker 3]
But, um...

[Nick Shirley]
And sir, do you think there's anything the Republicans and Democrats can do to reopen the government?

[Speaker 6]
Yeah, they should. We need the votes of the Democrats in the Senate to have closure, and so that we can open up the government. That's what we need to do.

Open the government, and then let's get back to work.

[Nick Shirley]
I just talked to this lady over here. She said she also works in the government. She said it's on the fault of the Republicans.

They're not opening the government and blaming Trump for not negotiating or not talking.

[Speaker 6]
No, look, we voted 13 times to keep the government open during the Biden years. We didn't put any requirements on that. We just kept the government open, even though there was a bunch of stuff that they did.

Excuse me, excuse me. I'm talking, okay?

[Nick Shirley]
Wow, look at some hostility out here outside of the Capitol. A lot of hostility.

[Speaker 6]
Look, we voted 13 times to keep the government open, during the Biden years. Even though we did not agree with a lot of the stuff, we never kept the government as hostage. And so, open the government, and let's get back to work.

[Nick Shirley]
Thank you. So what are you guys yelling at this guy for?

[Speaker 3]
We've already told you. Don't talk about it. We've already told you.

What are you doing? You have to ask Charlie Kirk, get out of here.

[Nick Shirley]
I am not trying to be Charlie Kirk. I'm asking you guys a question. You have a platform right now to voice your opinion about the government shutdown.

[Speaker 3]
We just talked to a representative.

[Nick Shirley]
He says it's because of the Democrats.

[Speaker 3]
We're not lying right now. We told you yesterday. We got a Nazi.

[Nick Shirley]
On the topic of the government shutdown, do you guys believe that the Democrats should vote to reopen the government? There's been over 10 votes so far.

[Speaker 12]
People are going to lose their health care, and people are going to die in result to that. So they're holding people accountable for it. They're holding like people's health care, because of the fact that, oh, if you guys want SNAP benefits, if you don't want to starve, then let's take away people's health care.

No, that is not a... Why would we do that?

[Speaker 3]
Why are we the only first world country without health care? Do you want health care?

[Nick Shirley]
I do want health care.

[Speaker 3]
Do you really think it's okay that these corporations privatize health care so people cannot get the surgeries they need, the medication they need? Do you think that's okay while all these other countries have free health care? And we're supposed to be the greatest country in the world, and yet everything is privatized.

[Nick Shirley]
Yeah, there's definitely some stuff that's wrong with health care here in the United States. And you guys think that they should reopen the government so they can negotiate furthermore?

[Speaker 3]
They're not going to negotiate. They're not going to negotiate. They had all the time to negotiate.

They're pushing lies. Undocumented people have never received assistance. That is not true.

So this whole propaganda that they're pushing, that they're trying to get health care for illegal aliens. First of all, how are you going to say someone's illegal on stolen land? This was colonized land.

Second of all, undocumented people do not receive assistance. Why is that lie continuing to be pushed? Why do we think some human beings are better than other human beings?

Do you think that you're better than her?

[Nick Shirley]
No, I do not. Okay, so she's Hispanic.

[Speaker 3]
She's Latino. How are you going to say that a human being is illegal? Do you know how broken our immigration system is?

[Nick Shirley]
And would you believe me if illegal migrants were actually getting benefits here inside the United States?

[Speaker 3]
They are not.

[Nick Shirley]
If I showed you a video right now, would you believe me?

[Speaker 3]
Because let me see your fake news because it's not true. Undocumented people do not receive assistance. That is not factually correct.

And I would like to see your source, to be honest.

[Nick Shirley]
These people were inside the Roe Hotel where there's also thousands of other illegal migrants living. Okay, what I have to say- Keep watching.

[Speaker 16]
Well, they're getting benefits. They're getting things that we should be paying people, things like this. Healthcare to me isn't an issue that we should be paying for.

With Medicare, yeah.

[Speaker 18]
Undocumented people do not receive assistance. Well, they're getting benefits.

[Nick Shirley]
And because of what's called the filibuster, there is needed 60 votes to pass a bill to reopen the government. Right now, there are 53 senators that are Republican that are voting to reopen the government. Meanwhile, they need just seven Democrats to vote to reopen the government.

And they have already voted more than 10 times. However, they have not been able to get enough votes from the Democrats to reopen the government. So I confronted one of the senators who has voted no each time to see what it would take for him to vote yes to reopen the government.

Senator, what will it take for you to vote to reopen the government to get your vote?

[Speaker 5]
We need to have an airtight guarantee that healthcare tax credits for purchase of insurance will be guaranteed. Americans need to be sure that they can afford healthcare insurance. And I will vote to reopen the government when there is a commitment to extend the healthcare tax credits that make health insurance affordable.

[Nick Shirley]
And Republicans are saying a lot of illegal migrants are getting a lot of benefits.

[Speaker 5]
Do you believe that? Undocumented immigrants are not receiving benefits under the ACA. It's prohibited by law and it's not happening.

[Nick Shirley]
And if you guys were to reopen the government and voted to reopen the government, do you believe Donald Trump would negotiate healthcare? I'm sorry, who are you? My name is Nick Shirley.

Okay. Do you think Donald Trump would negotiate with you guys with healthcare? Or do you trust his words?

[Speaker 5]
Donald Trump has refused to come to the table to even talk about a compromise. Compromise is not a four-letter word. We ought to be willing to talk.

Unfortunately, Donald Trump has absolutely refused to talk.

[Nick Shirley]
And now we are going to a protest to talk with the people there about the government shutdown. Before we go there, I want to tell you about the sponsor of this video, Opus Clip. What used to just be an AI clipper has now become the most powerful AI growth tool for creators.

Over 10 million creators and businesses have used it to receive over 60 billion views. And Opus is super simple. All you do is you upload a video or copy a YouTube link into Opus, and then it will come out with tons of perfectly edited shorts for you to post on all of your platforms, whether it be TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, you name it.

Opus is the place to go. And recently, Opus just came out their new AI editor 3.0 that comes with smarter auto framing, better virality scoring, and new captions. And if you're curious about how good Opus Clip's videos are, here are a few examples of people that have clipped my own videos, and they've received hundreds of thousands of views.

It's simply that easy with Opus. And Opus Clip is going to give you guys one week free and three months at 50% off. All I have to do is use code NICKSHIRLEY and go to the pinned comment or the link in my description.

I promise you guys, Opus is a game changer. Now, let's get back into the video. Now, we're outside of the White House, where there's typically a constant protest from one group or another.

Let's see what the people here have to say. We are outside the White House right now. Donald Trump is right there.

Do you think he is to blame for the government shutdown?

[Speaker 15]
Well, the president, they used to say the buck stops here, right? That he's in charge of the government. He says he's in charge of everything.

I hold him to his own words. Yeah, he's the president, right?

[Nick Shirley]
How do you think this government shutdown ends? The largest shutdown in history.

[Speaker 8]
How do I think it ends? I think maybe the Republicans come to their senses. They realize that they don't need to go down with the good ship Trump and they come back to the negotiating table.

[Nick Shirley]
Do you think Republicans are going to turn on Trump inside the Senate and the congressmen, congresswomen, everybody over at that building, over at the Capitol?

[Speaker 8]
I don't know how long it's going to take, but eventually they'll be like rats off a sinking ship.

[Nick Shirley]
If you were a Democrat, would you vote to reopen the government or would you stand strong with the other Democrats like Chuck Schumer?

[Speaker 8]
I don't see any point. You can't negotiate with these people. I think they have all the levers of power.

It's within their ability to reopen the government. If they don't want to, then let the American people see what we've got. Shame!

Shame!

[Nick Shirley]
Shame! Right now we have a bunch of handmaids with the middle finger yelling at the White House, saying shame to the White House right now. Should they reopen the government?

[Speaker 10]
And f**k Trump! Shame! That's all on the Republicans!

Shame! Shame! Shame!

Shame! Shame! Shame!

Republican shutdown! Shame! Donald Trump shutdown!

Holding people starving is not a hostage negotiation. That's disgusting.

[Nick Shirley]
What do you think about the people on Snap not getting the benefits to the full extent right now?

[Speaker 10]
Well, we don't give those people benefits so we can give billionaires their tax breaks.

[Nick Shirley]
Do you feel like what's going on in the government is a clash between the billionaires and the common people?

[Speaker 10]
It has been for decades. It's just gotten worse. He is the most blatant about it, for sure.

But it has existed for past presidents, not just Republican.

[Nick Shirley]
What do you think about this government shutdown?

[Speaker 7]
I'm happy the government's shut down.

[Nick Shirley]
And why are you happy the government's shut down?

[Speaker 7]
Because the people need to wake up.

[Nick Shirley]
And do you think there'll ever be a day underneath Donald Trump when Republicans and Democrats can sit down and discuss?

[Speaker 7]
No. They're r*****s. And those who aren't r*****s aren't really interested in discussing r*****s' ideologies.

[Nick Shirley]
Do you trust the government right now?

[Speaker 7]
No. Definitely not.

[Nick Shirley]
And you would not like it to get reopened?

[Speaker 7]
I don't... I don't know. That's, uh...

I think it needs to stay closed until Americans wake up.

[Nick Shirley]
Should they abolish the filibuster?

[Speaker 7]
Oh, no. No, no, no. No.

That's the only thing that's saving either side. You know what I'm saying? If you don't want something to go through the filibuster, it's what helps people take more time to get more research done.

[Nick Shirley]
With this government shutdown, AOC has been very outspoken about the shutdown. We just got access inside of this building, and we can go interview anybody. So I'm going to go straight to AOC's door and see what she has to say.

Hello, is AOC in today? She's not. She's not?

Is she in Washington, D.C.? Uh, sorry? Is she in Washington, D.C.? She's not. AOC is not here.

Dang it. All right, thank you. We did just try to talk to AOC.

She's currently not here inside of Washington, D.C. Unfortunately, because of the government shutdown, a lot of these congressmen and congresswomen are not here inside of Washington, D.C. because they are not required to be here because the government is currently shut down. So that's why a lot of these halls are just empty because the congressmen and congresswomen are not here. They're not getting paid.

But these people should be here if they're trying to work on some sort of resolution. But because the government shutdown and not getting paid, they don't technically need to be here. So if the resolutions are going to be made, you probably want your congressmen and congresswomen to be here inside Washington, D.C., but a lot of people just aren't here from the Republicans and Democrats. And right now in America, over 40 million Americans rely upon SNAP or EBT food stamps benefits here inside the United States to get their food. And right now, because of the government shutdown, instead of the full $9 billion that goes out every month, has been cut nearly in half. Now only $5 billion of that will be distributed to the American people.

Right now we're here in a lower-income neighborhood here inside Washington, D.C. area in Anacostia. We're speaking with the people about how the government shutdown has affected them. How do you feel about the government shutdown?

[Speaker 9]
I feel sorry for the people that is involved, but it don't bother me at all.

[Nick Shirley]
And have you guys lost any benefits? I know the people said to come here to Anacostia for...

[Speaker 13]
Well, I'm on food stamps, so next month I won't receive food stamps. And I really need these food stamps because I only receive...

[Speaker 11]
I don't want to get up on these cameras, man.

[Nick Shirley]
Okay, we were just talking with them.

[Speaker 11]
Man, y'all gotta do this like a type of way.

[Nick Shirley]
All right.

[Speaker 14]
Do you know where you're at right now?

[Nick Shirley]
Yeah, in Anacostia. They said to come here.

[Speaker 14]
What are you guys recording for?

[Nick Shirley]
Doing a video on the government shutdown.

[Speaker 14]
No, not over here.

[Nick Shirley]
Go more that way?

[Speaker 14]
No, just get out of this southeast. Go up, if you want interviews, like go up northwest or somewhere.

[Nick Shirley]
All right, sounds good. We'll get out of here. Within five minutes of being here in Anacostia, we got drug dealers mad at us on the corner, and then the police said, this is not the right space to be doing these interviews at.

This is where everyone told us to come in Washington, D.C. if we want to talk to people that have potentially been losing their SNAP benefits, but that's what has happened. We got kicked out real quick. How has the government shutdown affected you and your family or people in your neighborhood?

[Speaker 2]
So definitely there are a number of people in my neighborhood who have been receiving food stamps and other benefits and who have been severely concerned about, you know, Thanksgiving and just being able to provide for their families. There are a number of people who have been working who are experiencing hardship. And in a community like this, where, you know, we're in heavy pockets of communal poverty, it just calls for more violence, more of the things that we're supposedly trying to fight.

So it's definitely been hard press and hard hit on this end.

[Nick Shirley]
How come you feel like the government's not opening? It's the longest shutdown in U.S. history.

[Speaker 2]
I think we have an administrator or a president right now who's just not really to be bipartisan or work across the aisle. Unfortunately, he has his own agenda and everyone else is paying. Right now, if you think about it, he's shutting the government down and there are individuals who are impacted who are not eating.

If you think about it, when you think about the UN and the policies that we have in place in the UN, if a country did that, where people were not eating and a leader was holding off those resources, we would have a whole different conversation. So I think it's definitely an issue.

[Nick Shirley]
Because over 40 million people will either lose or not receive their full benefits from SNAP this month. That's over 10% of the U.S. population is dependent upon SNAP and EBT and food stamps.

[Speaker 2]
It's a major issue. I think financial literacy is like a bigger issue. I think sometimes, you know, just because of, I don't know, that's another conversation.

But I would say just short version, financial literacy is an issue. Education is an issue. If we have those things in place, you can take $5 and turn it into $100,000 with sound financial literacy principles and discipline.

[Nick Shirley]
How is the government shutdown affecting you and your family and people inside this neighborhood?

[Speaker 9]
It's affecting us because some people depend on food stamps and it's not working to provide for their family, for their New Year's. And people really rely on food stamps because that's how they get their food for Thanksgiving and stuff like that.

[Nick Shirley]
So are a lot of people arriving to the supermarket or to the gas station and then not being able to use their EBT cards? Is that what's happening?

[Speaker 9]
Yeah, because they don't, they said they're not giving out any government assistance since the government shutdown. So I feel like that's a little, that's a change.

[Nick Shirley]
Do you feel like families will starve if they don't open up to government? Yes. Has your family personally been affected from the government shutdown?

[Speaker 11]
Hell yeah. I've been affected from the government shutdown. I'm a felon.

I just came home from the feds. I'm trying to get a job. I can't even go through the programs.

I went through the program as soon as the government shutdown started. They said they not doing nothing. They said they ain't heard of the government shutdown.

I'm like, what y'all doing here? We consider it essential.

[Nick Shirley]
So that's something you may not have thought about with the government shutdown. He just came out of federal prison, but now because everything's federally shut down because of the shutdown, he can't go get a job now. Right, can't get a job.

But long live the man, freedom man. How's the government shutdown affecting people here inside this area, in this neighborhood?

[Speaker 4]
Let me tell y'all, in this particular neighborhood, I would say majority of the people rely on food stamps for food or food banks, either or, or both.

[Nick Shirley]
Would you say if the government doesn't reopen, families will go starving here inside these neighborhoods? Absolutely, absolutely. And who are people here blaming?

Are they blaming Trump? Are they blaming the Democrats? What do they think?

[Speaker 4]
I think everybody's blaming everybody. I think at this point in this climate, everybody knows that Republicans and Democrats, all it is the same.

[Nick Shirley]
And with what you said about so many people relying upon the government here, do you think this might be a wake-up call for people to realize that maybe we shouldn't rely so much on the government?

[Speaker 4]
I was just having a conversation with my friend about that. And I was saying the amount of people that is affected by this government shutdown and then not having their benefits is ridiculous. And that should, people should really sit down and think about that, that the government is not really reliable.

So you should always have either a source of income, some sort of a savings or backup plan, or have something going for yourself, a side hustle or something so that you can get your money. The government is not reliable. This government shutdown has proven that.

And so now people need to start coming up with, what do you call this? Contingency plans for themselves and their families for whenever the government fails us like they're doing now.

[Nick Shirley]
Because free, free, free sounds good until there's no more free stuff.

[Speaker 4]
And then now you got to figure it out, figure stuff out yourself.
