[Yeonmi Park]
Young people really don't know how tyranny comes to them in America. Usually, tyranny comes in the name of compassion and equality. They come and make these sweet, sweet promises of paradise.

They created the biggest concentration camp in human history. The whole country became a concentration camp. Nobody is allowed to leave North Korea.

North Koreans don't know they're enslaved by a dictator. So if you don't know you're a slave, how do you fight to be free?

[Nick Shirley]
And how much of a risk do you think North Korea actually is to the United States of America?

[Yeonmi Park]
Well, their eventual goal is destroying American, destroying capitalist societies.

[Nick Shirley]
What fears you most about fleeing socialism and seeing it coming back here into the United States? This is an interview between me and Yeonomi Park. She's one of the few people to ever escape North Korea and live to tell the tale about what life was like inside of North Korea and what life was like inside of a socialist government, inside of a socialist society.

And now with the rise of socialism and ideas like socialism and communism becoming more popular and more prevalent inside of our societies here in America and across the West, I wanted to bring her on and explain exactly what life was like for her living inside of North Korea and to explain how it was for her to escape the tragedies she faced living inside North Korea and the struggles she faced when she made it into China and eventually into the United States.

And now with threats on my life and it being more dangerous for me to go out and about to make my normal videos, I want to do one of these kind of long-form interview podcast style videos at least once a month to go more in depth on subjects that are so critically important right now here inside of the world we are currently living in. And I highly encourage you guys to share this video, give it a like, and more than anything share it with others and create thought-provoking conversations with the people that surround you. And now let's get into the interview.

How old were you when you decided to escape North Korea?

[Yeonmi Park]
I was 13 years old and I don't think I had an option. I was just starving.

[Nick Shirley]
When you decided to do that was it a sudden, was there something that triggered you to flee North Korea or was it an opportunity?

[Yeonmi Park]
It was just mostly hunger and luckily I was living in the border town so unlike the North Koreans who live inside the country, I got to see China through my naked eyes and Chinese eyes seemed like they had electricity. So that gave me a clue maybe they had a better situation than we did. So maybe if I go where the lights were, I might be able to find a bowl of rice.

[Nick Shirley]
How did you know that there was life on the other side of North Korea?

[Yeonmi Park]
So I was living in this city called the Haesan and we had one yellow river between China and North Korea. So I could even actually smell the food coming from the Chinese side. That's how close we were to China.

[Nick Shirley]
So you lived on a border town and did you know anything else besides North Korea and China?

[Yeonmi Park]
I heard like words like South Korea but then they were colonized by American vassals. That's what literary teachers taught us. I heard about Japanese imperialists and then maybe Soviet Union.

So I've never seen the map of the world until I escaped North Korea. So I just knew there are a few countries that were trying to attack North Korea and we were protected by the leader.

[Nick Shirley]
And so when you're living in North Korea, you don't know anything else outside of South Korea, China, Soviet Union. And you knew America existed.

[Yeonmi Park]
Right. So North Korea has 51 different caste systems and that determines your education level and who gets fed and who doesn't get starved. Right.

So I can never speak behalf of 25 million people because people like Kim Jong-un, he literally went to Switzerland to be educated. So based on your caste system, they decide how much you get educated. My case, I barely graduated like first grade.

So obviously I did not know anything about the world.

[Nick Shirley]
And when you look at the world now, how would you say your perspective has changed from when you were a little girl living in North Korea?

[Yeonmi Park]
You mean the world broadly that I see right now? Oh, world is very complex. I guess that's why you learn more and more as you get older.

[Nick Shirley]
What was life like on the daily inside North Korea? What was life like for you inside of North Korea?

[Yeonmi Park]
Yeah. So every move is orchestrated by the government. So when we wake up, literally the people's unit call up every unit to participate in this collective labor.

So even though you're five years old, seven years old, have to be forced in this labor, the government demands of you. So I start that they usually go to the monuments to clean the dictator statues and like pull out any little kind of grass. And then the times when I was going to school, I would go to school for a half day.

We learn about the dictator's amazing achievements, like he's a godlike figure, right? And in the afternoons, we also have to work as a kid. So a full day is a labor in the afternoon, and you come home by the time it's 10 p.m. Then you sleep in 5 a.m. The life begins again from the collective work.

[Nick Shirley]
What would they tell you about, was it Kim Jong-il?

[Yeonmi Park]
At the time it was Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il. He literally actually copied the Bible, the Christian Bible. It said that Kim Il-sung was God, that he loved us so much.

He gave us his son, Kim Jong-il. He knows even what we think in our head. And his body dies, just like Jesus Christ, but his spirit is with us wherever we go.

So when we die, we might join him in the paradise afterlife. So it's like complete North Korea, one of 10 religions in the world because of that. That's how they brainwashed North Korean people to believe that they have even like power to measure your thoughts.

[Nick Shirley]
And did you believe in that when you were in North Korea?

[Yeonmi Park]
Yeah, I did. I completely believed. Even when I was escaping China, I was even afraid to think.

[Nick Shirley]
Wow, we're going to get into that story of how you escaped China, but I want to get into that a little bit more as far as they literally copied the Bible to try and brainwash the people in North Korea.

[Yeonmi Park]
Yeah, so Kim Il-sung, he actually was born in a Christian family. His family members were devout Christians. But then when he became a Christian, I mean, the communist leader, he thought, how about I become God instead?

So he literally removed the God and put his name there and put his son's name, Kim Jong-il, into Jesus Christ's name. And then same doctrine. North Korea has 10 commandments, literally like the Bible.

And every week, instead of the confession time, we have a self-criticism time where we have to repent our sin. We read the words that Kim Il-sung supposedly wrote and compare to that how we lived our life. And then not only we confess our sin and ask for forgiveness, in North Korea, you're forced to criticize somebody.

If you're in school, your classmate. If you're in the workplace, your colleague. So that makes everybody have to watch out for someone's committing a crime.

You're forced to criticize. That's why nobody trusts anybody in North Korea. You are not allowed to trust anybody.

[Nick Shirley]
So every day you were kind of like looking for somebody to critique or then to bring up their name when it came to time to confess that somebody had committed a sin?

[Yeonmi Park]
Yeah, so for children, it's like once a week on Saturdays. We do these self-criticism sessions. But for people like artists or people who are in art, where the people's minds are more flexible, they need to do every two days.

So entire week as a kid, you are looking for your classmate making a mistake because you are forced to find a fault in somebody else.

[Nick Shirley]
And then what happens to that classmate that made the mistake?

[Yeonmi Park]
Depending on what I accuse them of. If I accuse them of that they said something horrible about the government, I mean, they're going to get executed. Or if I just said they were not paying attention during the class, they might have to do extra beating and something like that.

But then it depends on accusation. So you have to do your best not to get caught with your misbehaving.

[Nick Shirley]
Did you ever tell on somebody that led to the execution of that person?

[Yeonmi Park]
No, I think I literally had to just come up with this. They were not working as hard. Even though the leader demanded us to work very hard, they were not.

So they would have to say, okay, then I will do better next time, work even harder than before.

[Nick Shirley]
How many people do you know personally that died from the dictatorship or from the Kims?

[Yeonmi Park]
I mean, during the Korean War that began with Kim Il-sung invading the South in the 1950s, more than 5 million people died. So besides that, in the 90s, when I was growing up as a toddler, there are more than 3 million people died from starvation. So it's more than obviously 10 million by now that people died from this dictator.

[Nick Shirley]
You never hear about it anymore. I remember when Trump was first president, you heard a lot about the nukes and Kim Jong-un. But now it's like nobody hears anything about North Korea.

[Yeonmi Park]
Yeah, I think in some sense, people kind of accept that North Korea is so crazy. Like, right, it's been going almost 80 years now. So nobody remembers time before North Korea was this kind of autocratic.

So I think now they just accept that people are going to starve to death, accept that people are going to get executed for having an opinion.

[Nick Shirley]
When you were a child, you fled North Korea, you escaped when you were 13 years old. But what was your day-to-day like before that? You say you were starving.

[Yeonmi Park]
Yeah.

[Nick Shirley]
What would you guys be eating?

[Yeonmi Park]
Oh, anything, anything I could find. Like, I remember one time when I was playing with my friends when I was a kid. Like, he was so much faster than me.

I was a girl. He would catch a cockroach and then he pops his belly open. Inside the cockroach tummy, there's something looks like brown rice thing comes out.

And he would like put his mouth. So like, we would eat, you know, spiders, dragonflies. The fanciest protein I've ever consumed was like grasshoppers.

Grasshoppers were my favorite.

[Nick Shirley]
As a child, that was your favorite thing to eat was grasshoppers? Yes. And that was the fanciest protein you'd had?

[Yeonmi Park]
Yeah, because I did not know what, you know, fried chickens or steak. That was not a concept. Like, in North Korea, we don't know what cookbook is.

Because how do we come up with all those ingredients? No, no such a thing called like cookbook, right? I was so confused when I came to America.

There's like sections of cookbooks, like, you know, it's only luxury you can afford when you have those kinds of ingredients to find. So for us, whatever the gruel that we can make that day, whatever the plants we gather, whatever the grain that we come up with, we just put them together and add a lot of water to make the portion bigger. So our stomach feels like fuller that day.

[Nick Shirley]
You would eat grains, grasshoppers, cockroach?

[Yeonmi Park]
So like maybe corns, bollies, like a lot of plants we would eat. So, you know, like I literally thought plants were like rabbit food, right? I did not know people here eating salad to stay healthy.

But in North Korea, that was the only option we had. So a lot of plants.

[Nick Shirley]
Lots of plants.

[Yeonmi Park]
Yeah.

[Nick Shirley]
And did you think there was a life outside of what you had been living in? Did you think the people on the other side of China where you could see the lights from, did you think, oh, they were eating better than you? Or did you have any idea that life could be better?

[Yeonmi Park]
There were times that I got a glimpse of outside the world, was when I watched these like DVDs came from South Korea. These bootleg DVDs through black market that reached North Korea. Some of the movies were made in America, like Titanic, Pretty Woman.

Some other American movies like W. What's the 007 James Bond movies?

[Nick Shirley]
Yeah. James Bond.

[Yeonmi Park]
Yeah. I think that really gave me a little bit of a clue. Maybe they are not might be so bad.

But the government brainwashed you so much. They say the outside world is like corrupt capitalist societies where children's organs are harvested out of them. Children are begging on the streets.

We are so lucky we get to live in the socialist paradise. So there's no way of confirming what I saw on the side.

[Nick Shirley]
So meanwhile, you're starving, but you still think you're privileged.

[Yeonmi Park]
I still think we have nothing to envy. That's a song that we were forced to sing every day in North Korea. It's called Nothing to Envy because we live in a socialist paradise.

Everything is perfect. And I actually believe that. And this is a rare part.

A lot of people asking, I mean, you had your brains. How would you believe that you are literally starving and there are dead bodies everywhere, right? But George Orwell wrote about this.

Double think. The ability to have two contradicting thoughts at the same time. One, that you believe that you live in the best country in the universe.

And second, you still know that you are starving. And still somehow humans are capable of believing in both at the same time.

[Nick Shirley]
And where were you starting every single day?

[Yeonmi Park]
So it's like I. I do think I had more food before my father arrested because he was a he was working a black market and then he got caught when I was like seven or eight. That's when really my life came down to bad place.

But even when he was North Korean standard doing well, it wasn't like I was eating meat or fish. I was having some like maybe rice and then cabbage, pickled cabbage. And that was like the biggest privilege that North Koreans could afford.

[Nick Shirley]
Some cabbage and pickles. Yeah, man. And when you come here to America, do you feel just like so blessed when you see when you see somebody complaining about give me an extra scoop at Chipotle?

Are you like, what are you complaining about?

[Yeonmi Park]
I actually when I came to America, I did like a mission missionary work and we serve the people who are in Georgia, Atlanta at the time. And we would go to homeless shelters and clean their bed. And I couldn't believe in the homeless center.

They had a full fridge with the sodas and food. And then I would like give them hot dogs. And they ask, what do you have?

And they say no to it. Like I literally thought like the homeless people were like North Koreans are starving about to die from starvation. And it was a very different thing.

And the people who I served who are like, you know, who are marginalized groups and they were like having big TV in their living room. And I couldn't believe it. Like these people have a refrigerator at home and have a TV and have a sofa.

And then they consider to be in a poverty class. Because in North Korea, even though even a top, top official would not have that kind of thing, you know, you never have 24 hours electricity like that. It's a very different life standard, I think.

[Nick Shirley]
So the poor here in the United States would be the rich and richer than anybody.

[Yeonmi Park]
You can I get something that people can't even imagine it. That someone to have that kind of luxury.

[Nick Shirley]
And did you have the electricity when you're in North Korea?

[Yeonmi Park]
You would have a few times a year. So they would give electricity on the days of the dictator's birthdays. Because they want us to learn about the government propaganda.

And usually New Year's because the government have a new party plan that year. So we have to memorize. So like we would get a few times when this important government holidays they provide us, but other times zero.

No, we don't have any electricity.

[Nick Shirley]
Did you have candles or like how would you light stuff up?

[Yeonmi Park]
It wasn't as soon as the sun would go down. I mean, the times when we could afford like little oil and then little threads. But then it makes so much smoke like you look like you have a mustache.

But then even that is so valuable. We need to turn it off after five in the wintertime and go to sleep because it's so dark. So you might be able to afford it like 10 minutes here and there when you have to cook in the kitchen.

But we just have to go to sleep very early because we can't afford lights.

[Nick Shirley]
You're living in this horrible condition in North Korea. Your life's miserable. You're starving.

Your family's starving. And then you get this opportunity to leave. How did that come about to escape North Korea?

Because you've heard the stories of people who try to escape and it sounds like they just get shot instantaneously. How did you escape? And what was that like?

[Yeonmi Park]
My sister and I want to actually escape together. My sister was at the time 16 years old. I was 13.

I wasn't able to go with her because I was ill. But then when she left, she left me a note to go find a lady that would help me to cross the river. And this lady was helping us.

She bribed the border guards so they would not shoot us. And then as soon as we crossed the Yellow River, arrived in Chinese riverbank, we did learn why these people were helping us and not shooting us.

[Nick Shirley]
And how did she bribe them? And how did this lady have the connection?

[Yeonmi Park]
She was a human trafficker. So she was making money out of us. She was selling us as like slaves to Chinese.

And so they gave her the money and then she used that money to bribe the border guards.

[Nick Shirley]
So you didn't pay anything to pay for us to pay to leave?

[Yeonmi Park]
No, I mean, I didn't have the money. If I did, I would not have escaped, right? So.

[Nick Shirley]
Yeah, because I mean, for people to come into the United States to be smuggled across the border, they're paying the cartel.

[Yeonmi Park]
Yeah, but then they don't get sold when they come to America, right?

[Nick Shirley]
Yeah.

[Yeonmi Park]
But for us, we were being sold like puppies. Yeah, our rights and everything were stripped away from us. As soon as we get to China, we were getting raped.

[Nick Shirley]
Wow. And did you know that when you were crossing over? Did you have any idea?

[Yeonmi Park]
Because in North Korea, think about it. We don't have internet and we don't have such a thing called the bad news. I mean, we are revolutionaries.

We live in a socialist paradise. There's no such a thing called like, things go wrong, right? So news is always happy news, fake news.

So I did not know the term called human trafficking. I never knew how is it possible for a human to sell another. And I'm not a chicken.

How is that possible? So I did not know that that was a thing. When I got to China, I learned that that was human trafficking.

[Nick Shirley]
What was the night like when you left?

[Yeonmi Park]
It was very cold. I left in 2007, March, end of March. It was freezing.

So thankfully, because of that, the river was not frozen. Like, it was still frozen. We were able to walk across the frozen river.

We didn't have to be in the ice.

[Nick Shirley]
And who did you cross with?

[Yeonmi Park]
With my mom and then with a guy who was transferring us to Chinese broker. And he still didn't tell us that we were going to China to be sold.

[Nick Shirley]
And at what point did you realize that what you just did was to sell yourself or to be sold to traffickers?

[Yeonmi Park]
Well, when we got to Chinese Riverbank, the guy who was waiting for us, he brought something like this kind of carpet thing. And then he was ready to leave us. And the first thing he was saying, I want to have sex with her was me.

And I did not know what that was, because we don't have the word in North Korea for sex. But somehow my mom knew what that meant. And she offered herself and she protected me.

And that was my introduction to sex in China. And afterwards, they separated my mom and me and then sold us separately.

[Nick Shirley]
So the moment you get over to China.

[Yeonmi Park]
It was as soon as we touched the ground of China. The first thing was that.

[Nick Shirley]
And this might be a stupid question, but is the language in China and North Korea the same?

[Yeonmi Park]
No, Chinese speaks Mandarin and Koreans speak Korean. But then these were Korean ethnic Chinese. So there are many, many long time ago.

There are some Koreans live in the northern part and that became China. So they were speaking ethnic Korean Chinese. But they were Chinese people.

[Nick Shirley]
So your mom sacrificed herself in that moment for you. And at that point, you're 13 years old.

[Yeonmi Park]
Yeah.

[Nick Shirley]
So you're obviously still a virgin and you had no idea. You didn't know what the word sex was.

[Yeonmi Park]
I did not know. Because in North Korea, a lot of words like we have here, they don't exist. Like the word freedom or human rights, they don't have it.

Because if you know the word, you understand the concept. So in order to control your thinking, governments have to control the language and words. Right?

So they eliminate this kind of words in our dictionary.

[Nick Shirley]
So you really had no idea that any of that world existed?

[Yeonmi Park]
No.

[Nick Shirley]
And your mother, obviously, she had to. So she obviously knew what sex was.

[Yeonmi Park]
I think she kind of assumed what he was doing. And then she just offered herself. And that's, yeah.

[Nick Shirley]
What was that moment like for you to be standing there as a 13 year old? People are negotiating. Your body.

And then your mom comes in and says, no, don't do it. I'll go.

[Yeonmi Park]
No, actually. So after they raped her, I do remember my mom asked me to turn around and cover your ears. I turned around, I closed my eyes, I covered my eyes.

And then they took us to a safe house called a house where they will now start selling us. And then that's when they said I also had to be sold as a slave. And so they decided to sell my mom for $65.

And they decided to sell me over $200 because I was a child version. And men love taking that away in China. So I got separated from my mom.

[Nick Shirley]
Where did your mom go?

[Yeonmi Park]
I did not know at the time because, I mean, I was also sold separately. And eventually I did find her through the man who bought me. The man who bought me, I was not going to give in.

I was going to kill myself. And then he said, if I do give in and become his, his mistress, he said he was going to help me to save my family.

[Nick Shirley]
So you didn't separate from your mom.

[Yeonmi Park]
You go with another man who bought me, a Chinese man who didn't speak any Korean. And then he made me a deal. He offered me a deal that if I don't kill myself and obey him, he said he was going to help me to save my family.

[Nick Shirley]
And did he also rape you?

[Yeonmi Park]
Of course he did. That was the price. So he raped me and then he did help me to save my family.

[Nick Shirley]
And how long were you with him for?

[Yeonmi Park]
More than a year.

[Nick Shirley]
What would you have to do with this man? Like on a day-to-day basis, you wake up in the morning.

[Yeonmi Park]
He would lock me up because he was a human trafficker.

[Nick Shirley]
He would lock you up?

[Yeonmi Park]
So he was a human trafficker. He was buying these girls from—so there are many brokers, right? The guys who capture us from the border.

And then they sent us to another broker in the inner China. And then this guy was the guy who bought me. And then he would be selling girls either to fake husbands in the countryside, or to another broker who would find them fake husbands or send them to brothels.

So he was a second-layer broker. And so he had to go around and buy the girls and go take them to the countryside and sell them. So a lot of times he would just lock me inside the apartment and he would disappear for like 40 days.

And I'd be isolated inside the room. I don't know. I didn't have a phone or calendar.

I don't know how long I was in there. But he would like buy me food before he would go. And then I did not know how to ration it to myself because I don't know when he's coming back.

[Nick Shirley]
You'd be in self-isolation for months.

[Yeonmi Park]
Yeah.

[Nick Shirley]
And did you ever—what did you think in those times? What were some of the darkest moments?

[Yeonmi Park]
I think that's when I realized I drained all my tears. You can reach to a point as a human being where you don't have any more tears left. And I lost my faith in humanity completely by that point.

But the only thought that let me keep going was in the hope of finding my family.

At a certain point in your life, do you wonder, like, what's the point of living or did you have any hope for a better life?

[Yeonmi Park]
Of course, I mean, back then I did not know life could be this way with dignity, with rights, right? I've never read the U.S. Constitution by then, so I did not know. And dying was the easiest option I had, literally, because killing yourself takes five minutes, but living takes forever.

So, so many times I want to kill myself, but the thought of my family, that I could save them, I think kept me going.

[Nick Shirley]
And you say that you had red tears.

[Yeonmi Park]
Yeah.

[Nick Shirley]
When you were crying, what were you thinking in those moments?

[Yeonmi Park]
I think, I thought North Korea was very bad, right? I had nothing to eat. Literally, hunger is the most devastating thing when you go through starvation.

But now I came to China, I might get some food, but all the meaning in life disappeared. I was not even free to go to bathroom on my own. So I think, like, yeah, I just literally realized somehow the North Korea and China was what the whole world was.

I thought China would be a better place and I didn't expect it to be so bad.

[Nick Shirley]
And so you, at that point, did you think like, why did I even leave North Korea?

[Yeonmi Park]
No, because if I didn't leave, I would be dead by then. I would not survive. I was starving and you can't survive when you don't eat.

So it was still China was in some sense better than North Korea because at least kept me alive to, you know, food. But North Korea, that was not even guaranteed.

[Nick Shirley]
And who were these men? You say they were farmers. And why did these farmers need a woman?

[Yeonmi Park]
Yeah, so this is interesting. Great question. There are, you know, you know, Chinese government had a one child policy under communist party because they thought they had too much population and they thought that was a bad thing.

So they limited people to have only one babies and a lot of people kept the boys and killed the girls. So now these people grew up, became adults and there are not enough women to go by.

[Nick Shirley]
So with that one child policy, whether the government knew it or not, there was more women being born than men.

[Yeonmi Park]
No, people would abort if they realized they had a girls. Or if the girl was born, they would flip her and kill her until she dies. And people only want to keep the boys, right?

So in China, I think a lot of people who grew up in Christian values, they believe that life is intrinsically valuable. But in the communist world, life is not something that dignified thing. So Chinese government would punish people if they had more than one kid.

So because of that, if you gave birth to a girl, a lot of them just killed their own babies and then wait and keep trying until they had the boys. And if they had one boy and that was it, they get the IUD or they get the forced civilization. And government would not allow them to have any more children.

So this resulted in lacking of women, lacking of girls because they killed too many girls by then.

[Nick Shirley]
So people started aborting the women, the girls inside the wombs of Chinese females. And then that led to a decrease in women and more men. And then they brought in people like you that were sex trafficked.

Because some of these men could not get women.

[Yeonmi Park]
Yeah, so there are right now currently 33 million men can't find wives in China. And that's a lot of men. And that number is going to keep growing, right?

So China's Communist Party thought, well, we don't want this young man who can't even find a wife, start revolution. We got to appease them somehow. And that is by allowing state-sponsored human trafficking.

That's how they allowed North Korean girls' babies to be sold like sex slaves in China.

[Nick Shirley]
So China knows that there's lots of women being trafficked. Of course they do know that, yeah.

[Yeonmi Park]
There are more than 300,000 of them right now.

[Nick Shirley]
And they don't do anything to stop it?

[Yeonmi Park]
They did themselves, I mean, rape these women. These officials did themselves raping, buying these girls on the side.

[Nick Shirley]
And how often were you being raped?

[Yeonmi Park]
So I was, in some sense, I was lucky. I was not sold to another farmer or to a brothel, right? Because that's usually where we end up, like in the countryside where the man has a disability.

They might be mentally not well or physically not well. So that's why they cannot find normal Chinese women, right? So families would be paying money and then buy the girl.

And then maybe the uncles and fathers and brothers go around and rape her. Or to brothels where you get raped 100 times a day. But the man who was supposed to buy me, he realized that I was a virgin.

And he wanted to keep me for himself. So I wasn't ever exposed to so many other people, like most of North Korean women are. And he eventually fell in love with me.

He really loved me. And that's why he let me go at the end. So that's the thing, the complication of being a human, right?

This monster that would abuse me and eventually found his humanity and would look at me as a human being and would let me go.

[Nick Shirley]
As he fell in love with you, did you ever have any feeling towards him or did you have a deep hatred towards him?

[Yeonmi Park]
Initially, I wanted to, I fantasized him killing this man every second I saw him. I literally, I want to kill him so much. But I realized he was also a victim.

He grew up in a communist society where he did not learn how to treat a human being better. And also he was joined the gang as an elementary school child. And he was also a victim of the society, of this communist system.

And that's why, that's how he behaved. So I forgave him. And I actually even helped him when I came to America.

[Nick Shirley]
Really? Do you still keep in contact with him?

[Yeonmi Park]
We found him because my mom and I found him and then I want to thank him for letting me go. But then I did not want to stay in touch afterwards because I felt like I did my portion of giving back.

[Nick Shirley]
And now here in the United States, you're seeing kind of this rise of communism.

[Yeonmi Park]
Yeah.

[Nick Shirley]
Of socialism.

[Yeonmi Park]
Yeah.

[Nick Shirley]
Here in New York City, they just elected a democrat socialist who him himself has said, well, if landlords don't take care of people's rents, we're going to go in or their apartments, we're going to go in and we're going to take over that apartment.

[Yeonmi Park]
Yeah.

[Nick Shirley]
You lived in a socialist society. What would be your warning to people who advocate for socialism or who advocate for the revolutionary communist party here inside the United States? What's your warning to those people who think, oh, maybe socialism would be good?

[Yeonmi Park]
Yeah, I think it's, I had to keep thinking about it. I mean, I voted this election this time and obviously Mandan is still one. And I can't believe my fate that somehow I keep running towards like socialist government systems, right?

Whenever I escape. The young people really don't know how tyranny comes to them in America. They somehow tyranny comes with like a dark suit and guns and they're going to come and tell them, I'm going to enslave you.

Usually tyranny comes in the name of compassion and equality. They come and make these sweet, sweet promises of paradise. Like that's how North Korean regime began.

The Kim Il-sung came to my grandmothers and said, look at the capitalists. They are so rich. And look at the peasants.

Their children can't even get educated and they cannot even be treated in the hospital. How about I create a society where everybody gets a free education, free healthcare, free housing, free food. And then we get rid of inequality because this is evil.

And why would you not want that? It sounds so fantastic, right? Everybody live life with dignity.

Nobody suffers from poor health. And people wanted that. So my grandmothers gave up their private property.

They gave up freedom of speech. They gave up freedom of movement. They gave up all their rights to live in this paradise.

But we know that when government took all their rights away from people, they did not create a paradise. They created the biggest concentration camp in human history. The whole country became a concentration camp.

Nobody is allowed to leave North Korea. Nobody allowed to enter even right now, right? So Mandani exactly promised same thing that Kim Il-sung promised to my grandmother generation saying, it's evil.

There are billionaires and there are people who are poor, can't even afford the rent. Why don't I come in and make all like free for you guys? And nothing is free in the world.

Nothing is free. And this entitlement generation, this young people that I see in New York, who are so unbelievably entitled, they somehow think they deserve free buses. And like, why do you need to get that for free?

So we have a huge issue because American education system have failed teaching these people about tyranny.

[Nick Shirley]
This new excitement for socialism, you see it from these people at these colleges. You see it from the people that are being educated at schools like NYU, these Ivy League schools. And you're seeing what should be the smartest people become indoctrinated to the level where they think everybody deserves everything for free, essentially.

Whether it be free buses, or whether they should be able to stabilize rents, or just ability to make X amount of money that rich people shouldn't exist, that they should be taxed more, which they already are taxed more than people who make less money than the rich. Why do you think inside of these universities and whatnot, you're seeing this indoctrination at levels that's never been seen before here in the United States?

[Yeonmi Park]
I wouldn't say it's like the issues of the overeducation. The issues, I mean, myself, I went to Columbia University in New York, and I found something that I wasn't expecting to see in the capital, in a city of the world, right? In New York City, professors will be anti-West, anti-freedom, anti-American, anti-free market, Marxists will be teaching these kids.

But then I also saw these kids who were already radicalized in their high school, or before they got to even college. So I think the American education system itself took over by the Marxist teachers, and that's why we are seeing this bright, bright young people are wanting something like Venezuela, like Cuba, North Korea had, and think somehow this time will be different. I will never know why American people allow this happen to this far, because, but it seems like it's not just colleges, I believe schools, that's an issue.

It seems like from the public school times, or everybody get brainwashed by the time and they're going to college.

[Nick Shirley]
What fears you most about fleeing socialism and seeing it coming back here into the United States?

[Yeonmi Park]
Well, the history repeating itself. It's unbelievable. But I do have more hope for America, because at least in America, they have second amendment.

People can have arms. I think if the governments will take that away from people, we will never be like, no longer different than China or North Korea.

[Nick Shirley]
Because in North Korea, do you guys have any way of going against the government?

[Yeonmi Park]
No, because there are no guns. And when in North Korea, when one person commits a crime, they punish anybody that's related to that person is guilty by association. So when one person says something that is not for the government, they come for three to eight generations.

But when that happens, if you have the guns, we should not fight. Well, I mean, you're going to all get killed anyway. So that's why the first thing that the dictators did was getting rid of the arms from the people.

But as long as America has different states and people have ability to protect themselves, I don't think we can ever reach the North Korean level of tyranny in America, even if we revolt socialism.

[Nick Shirley]
Yeah, what's so interesting about what's happening in the United States right now is obviously Trump's president. But you're seeing almost how much limited power he has when he wants to go and do something inside of a certain state. And then all the states says no, or say he wants to come to New York City and deport illegal migrants.

People freak out. Because I get they have to go through all these different ways of going through the state with the federal government and whatnot that people are realizing like, well, Mondami here, he's a Democrat socialist. He doesn't believe anybody should be deported.

He doesn't want to comply with ICE or anything. And meanwhile, you have a president who got elected by the majority of people here in the United States who said that he was going to deport illegal migrants here in the United States.

[Yeonmi Park]
Yeah.

[Nick Shirley]
But you have somebody like Zora Mondami, who's the Democrat socialist, and he's saying, no, we're not going to do this. And we're actually going to do all this stuff to make it even harder. And if he wants to come through me, he's going to have to go through all of New York City.

[Yeonmi Park]
Which I'm not part of. I don't support him at all.

[Nick Shirley]
But so many of these young people are.

[Yeonmi Park]
Yeah.

[Nick Shirley]
And they've kind of forgotten the life of how America got great, or they've forgotten how America got great. And that was from strict laws and from the border and from vetting immigration, not just letting anybody come into the United States. But this idea of socialism and communism, just everyone's equal, that we should follow this and that, it's kind of destroying a lot of these big cities here in the United States.

And it's destroying, corrupting the minds of individuals.

[Yeonmi Park]
Yeah.

[Nick Shirley]
Which is frightening, I think.

[Yeonmi Park]
I think it's like a moment for us to be all like taking a responsibility of why the country became this way, I think. So one thing that I always like made me shocked was that by this liberal say, you know, the poor people always are poor people. They deserve that.

They deserve this, right? And then always demonize the rich people. If being poor is not a bad thing, why being rich is a bad thing?

We don't ever say you are so late, that's why you're poor. We don't do that. We have compassion for them.

But when people who work so hard and become rich, we demonize them. And just morally, it's just not acceptable when we do that as a society. It's not a crime to be rich.

And now it is under social system. It's a crime to be high-functioning, innovating individual, right? They punish you for your hard work and discipline.

So that's why the communism is so immoral in my stance. I can never accept such a fly ideology. But other than that, I think we also responsible for not educating our children right.

All these kids raised by their parents. And I do wonder what their parents did with their children's education. Maybe they were so obsessed to what kind of college they get into.

They didn't understand the values that these people were hoarding. So it is a time for all of us to look back. I mean, I'm a mom now.

I do know I have an immense responsibility to raise my son. Not just sending him to good college, but like him to understand the world properly. So I think a lot of people just fail that educating their kids better.

And now we are seeing this young people think they know everything. They literally think they know everything without paying tax even one time in their life. Can you just imagine this idiocy, right?

These people think they know everything about the world without even like running a household once in their lifetime.

[Nick Shirley]
Yeah, because all these kids, especially these college universities, most of them, if they paid taxes, one, it's very little. And two, the money they're living off right now is from loans. So they're kind of living off some unlimited...

[Yeonmi Park]
Or their parents.

[Nick Shirley]
Or their parents a lot of times, right? And so people don't understand like how hard it is to go make X amount of dollars to be able to afford to pay for, I don't know, say like a rich person's apartment here in New York City, $10,000 a month. That's a lot of money.

And they've never made $10,000 in their month, right? So these people are just like getting so angry about stuff that they've never even had to go out and do by themselves because one, they're either on a loan or they're on their parents' bank account.

[Yeonmi Park]
Yeah, I think socialism is just like in the relation of envy, right? Oh, they're a billionaire. They're in the private jet.

That's why my life sucks now. I can't afford this. And also, I mean, this ideology destruction.

Oh, because I can't afford all of this, let's make all of us poor instead, right? Because I don't want to see anybody doing better than me. So how about we all poor and starve and just suffer equally?

And it is such a wild, wild idea that I think that we should do better job educating our next generation. And there are so many people learning about World War II or Hitler or anything, but they don't learn about the horrors of communism. They don't understand there are more than 130 million human beings perished in the 20th century because of socialism.

And they think somehow it was not implemented correctly. That is the only thing they can come up with. And oftentimes they keep asking me, what about the Nordic countries like Denmark, Norway, Sweden?

They have socialism. No, they have free market system. We do a lot of welfare.

It's not socialism. Government does not control the means of production. And socialism can never work.

And it is such a limited education the young people get now.

[Nick Shirley]
Do you see any similarities between Zoran Mandami and those socialist communist leaders that you fled from?

[Yeonmi Park]
He reminds me of Kim Il-sung. I mean, Kim Il-sung came with a very charismatic, charming smile to Nordic people and making these sweet, sweet promises to my grandmothers. And they all believed him.

I mean, they chose Kim Il-sung. He was not something that he forced people to accept him. It was a majority chose him.

And we also learned in democracy that is the only downside of democracy is that tyranny of a majority. Now I'm under tyranny of a majority in New York City. I don't want Mandami, but then majority chose him.

So now I have to live with that, right? And thankfully, at least in America, we have 50 states. I have a choice to go to Texas or Florida if I want to.

And we should keep the country like this, have different states and different laws. And the federal government should not force one law to all the states.

[Nick Shirley]
Very well said. I want to go back to a little bit of your life in North Korea and the suffering that you saw from other people and the suffering that you experienced. What's some stories that would horrify the average American or the average person living in this world about the atrocities that take place and that you saw with your own eyes?

[Yeonmi Park]
Yeah. I think there's a saying, like if you starve people for like three days, the civilization collapse. Nobody acts like a human anymore, right?

I don't think people truly grasp what it means to live in a country where we don't have prosperity. Because Americans, their problem is having too much food. Our issue is like dealing with obesity now, right?

It's not a lack of nutrition. Before when people die from starvation, there are like different stages. And you know you're hungry.

And then you actually lose your mind. And you just laugh hysterically. And before you die, I think all your body like holes just open.

Your internal organs just like fall out. That's how long it takes for you to die in that kind of way. And I think when people just toying this idea, well, like not having this kind of prosperity is not such a bad thing.

It is that bad thing. It is like unthinkable thing. And I think that's what I get.

People think somehow if someone dying from starvation is like dignified way of dying, right? They don't understand you lose your mind before you die. And entire body organs come out of it.

They don't even understand that. Because they never seen hell on earth before.

[Nick Shirley]
And did you see people dying on the streets with their organs coming out of their bodies?

[Yeonmi Park]
Yeah, I have seen so many of them. Like because no muscle, nothing left to hold it together. So it just pours out of you.

And that's right before you die. And so many people just hysterically laughing on the street. And they lost their mind because they are starving so much and they lose their mind.

And that's when we realize when somebody start laughing, oh, he stays like very near. He's gonna die soon.

[Nick Shirley]
Well, so people don't have the nourishment inside their bodies, want to feed their brain, and they just go crazy.

[Yeonmi Park]
Yeah, they do. Like usually when someone says, I'm hungry and I want food. It's like we don't worry about them.

You haven't reached that stage. But the ones that really get there, it's like usually they lose their mind. They don't recognize their children.

They don't recognize themselves. They just laugh and go literally, like literally a crazy person, right? And then after that, that phase over when they can't even laugh and move around.

That's when everything just opens up and organs come out of them. And that's when we know that's how life ends in starvation.

[Nick Shirley]
And does North Korea do anything to go and grab those people or do they hide it from the public? Or how did you see that? Was it openly happening in public?

[Yeonmi Park]
Yeah, I mean, government don't care. They don't have like even oil or gas to drive the trucks to move these bodies, right? They can't even do that for us.

So if sometimes they might like, so many people die in the train stations and they become like just wood. Like your body stiffs when you die and become cold and frozen, right? So usually they stack them up and sometimes they remove.

But a lot of times it's like left there discarded.

[Nick Shirley]
Do rats come in and eat the people or do people eat the humans?

[Yeonmi Park]
Sometimes they do. Sometimes they do. But then usually rats eat the people and then we catch the rats and we eat them.

But then these rats have disease and then we die. Then they eat us back. So this cycle continues.

So like us eating the rats and they eat us back.

[Nick Shirley]
So meanwhile, people are dying. The rats eat the humans and the humans eat the rats and then the rats eat the humans. And it's like a cycle in North Korea.

And so simultaneously you're kind of eating other people.

[Yeonmi Park]
And there are so many stories we hear. We go to black markets and buy the meat. And a lot of times we don't know what that meat is.

[Nick Shirley]
Did you believe that you've eaten human before?

[Yeonmi Park]
No, we never had enough money to buy those meat. But then there are times we would catch people selling those kinds of meat and then police would execute them.

[Nick Shirley]
And would they do public executions in North Korea?

[Yeonmi Park]
All the time. It's mandatory for children to attend and adults to attend. So every time when there's a public execution all the schools have to go and the workforce also have to show up.

And they sit based on your height. So if you're two years old, you're in the front because you're the shortest, right? And then first grade, second grade, sitting like that.

So the very first thing as a human being you get to see is seeing another human getting executed in front of your eyes.

[Nick Shirley]
How old were you when you saw your first person being executed?

[Yeonmi Park]
I was an infant. I was in my mom's back. I wasn't able to even sit.

And that's how early I got to see the public execution. And the ones I remember was when I was a toddler, I think maybe five or seven. That's in my memory.

But I asked my mom, when was the first time I attended a public execution? It was like when you're an infant in my back and wrapped around. That's when I had to take it to see it.

[Nick Shirley]
And how would they do the public executions? Was it just a military man comes and shoots somebody or would the crowd have to participate or how did that happen?

[Yeonmi Park]
It's very methodical. It's not like I have seen these beheadings by ISIS or even Hamas, right? But North Korean people, when they get executed, they don't even get to have the last say.

So the first they do is they break on your bones, on legs and bones, everything. And they break all your teeth and they put big rock in your mouth. So before you get executed, you could say something that is opposing the government, right?

So they prevent that. They put a big rock in your mouth and break all your bones. So you're like, you are not able to walk.

And then you're blindfolded. So they would drag this body who can't even walk. It's like almost dead by then.

Then they wrap them around. Usually happens in the marketplaces or like stadiums where many people can come or people that can assist to come. Then they read out their crime and then they shoot like from head, chest, stomach and then legs.

So this collapse like this become a wall and then they put it out.

[Nick Shirley]
And does the crowd celebrate when these executions are taking place?

[Yeonmi Park]
I mean, we have to. It's not like something we have an option to. They say this person committed this kind of crime and then we have to say you're the enemy of our revolution.

We have to denounce these enemies. But those people don't get to even have any last word.

[Nick Shirley]
And when you're a child seeing this, are you celebrating like in your head when you're going back to your home? Are you like, oh my gosh, thank goodness that person was killed?

[Yeonmi Park]
I don't know because I just think you're numb in North Korea. You're just numb. This is such a normal thing.

So I don't remember having emotions about it. It was like, okay, another execution, another person dies. Like it's not something you feel.

You know, it's like you're here like right now and looking at New Yorkers walking by. You have no feeling because that's something given to you, right? Just like that.

It's not something that affects you in any other way because it's been so regularly happening to you since you're a baby. It's subconsciously just another thing of being alive in North Korea.

[Nick Shirley]
Would it be possible to have a revolution where people were to say, we're done with the Kims and we do not want to listen anymore to them. We want to overthrow the government and we want to try to start our own political party. Is that even a possibility?

[Yeonmi Park]
So there are two issues doing that. One is North Koreans don't know they're enslaved by a dictator. So if you don't know you're a slave, how do you fight to be free?

Right. So like people right now, we see in New York, the people don't know they're brainwashed. They literally think they know everything about the world and socialism is the answer to all the problems, right?

So one, like North Korean people don't know they're brainwashed. They don't know they live under dictatorship. They think they live under the most benevolent communist party.

So that's an issue. Two, even if you knew the dictator was there and you're enslaved, you are starving. You don't have freedom of movement.

You cannot go to next town. There's no internet. How do you reach out to the people you want to fight together?

How do you even go to that town? Because you can't. And only thing you are allowed to search is next meal because you're starving.

If you fail to find dinner, you don't make it. If you fail, next day you woke up, fail to make the fine food, you're not gonna alive. That's why people, government kept us starving.

North Korean regime, with the money they conduct missile tests, right? They do like hundreds of them a year. One missile test can feed the entire nation for entire year.

So nobody die from starvation.

[Nick Shirley]
So it's a choice to starve you guys.

[Yeonmi Park]
They, it's like Hunger Games. It's a tool the government use to control people through starvation. So people are starving.

They have no luxury to think about freedom or meaning of life. The only thing they can afford to think about is finding next meal. So they don't have time, energy to do anything.

And that's why regime just keeping them starving.

[Nick Shirley]
So that's the best way to control and massacre people is to keep them starving. So that way they can never think about what can we do next? Because the main target for that day, each and every single day, is to go get food.

[Yeonmi Park]
Every single moment you're alive in North Korea is finding food.

[Nick Shirley]
And you say it's the largest concentration camp in the world, North Korea, right now.

[Yeonmi Park]
The whole country is a prison camp. You're not allowed to go to river. There's a border guards.

There's a curfew. The whole border between China and North Korea is like buried in landmines. Electrified wire fences with machine guns.

It got worse after I escaped. Now you can't escape from North Korea. So the whole country is a concentration camp.

[Nick Shirley]
And why do you think Kim Jong-un now does this? Because Kim Jong-il, his father did it. Why do you think he continues to do this?

If he knows that people are suffering. Do you think he thinks he's killing people? Or do you think he thinks he's innocent?

[Yeonmi Park]
I'm sure in his own mind, he thinks he's doing the right thing. Not giving up the idea of socialism, right? Not giving in to the corrupt capitalism.

And like he always saying, we are the last country of holding the flag of socialism. We should feel the pride in that. So I'm sure in his mind, the West is evil.

Capitalism is evil. And he is defending this amazing idea of socialism in North Korea. So his work is noble.

And when it comes starving of the people, he thinks those are just tools. They are collectives. They mean nothing.

Individuals mean nothing in the common society. So he doesn't view life as how we view it here. So then he's not committing any crime.

So there are many ways to justify yourself in that system.

[Nick Shirley]
Do you think he ever sees that man struggling on the street with his organs coming out of his body? Does he ever see that?

[Yeonmi Park]
I don't think he gets to see that because he will never come to the commoners like us on the street and see that. But then I'm sure he knows the figures of how many people are dying from starvation, right? But he, I mean, he literally executed his own uncle.

He poisoned his own brother in Malaysia. Do you remember the news? I mean, nerve agent, he uses curse and assassinating his half-brother in Malaysia.

[Nick Shirley]
Yeah, because somebody was supposed to take reign before him, correct? Or somebody had the right to take reign?

[Yeonmi Park]
Because the firstborn son is usually the legit heir. And he's come from the concubine's third wife. So he doesn't have the legitimacy, like he's the firstborn son from the main wife.

That's why he killed his half-brother.

[Nick Shirley]
It was his half-brother he killed?

[Yeonmi Park]
Yeah, the father's the same, but moms are different.

[Nick Shirley]
Yeah, so there was supposed to be another leader who could have potentially been in his spot right now. And he killed that guy in Malaysia. And how does North Korea survive?

Is it just purely through missile test? Or how do they get money if they're not exporting anything? If they're not producing anything?

Because obviously the farms aren't prosperous there, right? You guys aren't getting food.

[Yeonmi Park]
Yeah, so many things. They counterfeiting USD dollars. So they print most believable USD dollars.

[Nick Shirley]
They print what?

[Yeonmi Park]
Print US dollars, the counterfeiting, the currency. They sell drugs. So a lot of even drugs that reach America come from North Korea.

They make something called the crystal meth. They cultivate the opium on the ground and sell it to the Western countries. They sell illegal arms.

So they provide arms even to Hamas, to Iran. Even right now with the Ukrainian-Russian war, the rockets come from North Korea. They sell their soldiers to the Russian government right now and let them die in the war with Ukraine.

So many North Korean soldiers were sent there and died. And the kingdom gets paid. And they steal bitcoin.

So they have so many hackers who go around stealing bitcoin and banking system. So they would like withdraw money from ATM machines from other countries. Another way of them making money is also sending their own girls to China, have these beautiful restaurants, and then earn the foreign currency.

So they sell their own people.

[Nick Shirley]
So the only way they're making money is through doing stuff that is detrimental to societies. Like selling drugs, weapons, sex trafficking. Anything that is ill and devilish, they are doing.

[Yeonmi Park]
Yeah, I don't know if you recently saw that. Because of remote work now, a lot of North Korean hackers and engineers in China, and they go to Russia and apply for American companies. Like Amazon or Apple, big American companies, they apply jobs as engineers.

And then they make the money and send it to the government. There's so many North Korean agents actually working for American governments already.

[Nick Shirley]
Would those people be considered spies in your eyes?

[Yeonmi Park]
Of course, I mean, they are absolutely spies, right? The government would send them in the purpose of surveillance and earning the foreign cash.

[Nick Shirley]
And how much of a risk do you think North Korea actually is to the United States of America?

[Yeonmi Park]
Well, their eventual goal is destroying American, destroying capitalist societies, right? That's what they're going for. That's why every single time their missile conduct ability goes up.

And they want to reach a capacity where they can annihilate America completely.

[Nick Shirley]
Do you think that's their end goal is to annihilate America?

[Yeonmi Park]
That's their end goal. Yeah, they don't want to see free capitalist societies. The socialist systems are not tolerant like capitalist societies.

They can't coexist with people who disagree with them. So they have to eliminate all of the capitalist societies.

[Nick Shirley]
Do you think Trump's a good president to have with dealing with people like Kim Jong-un? Or do you think it'd be better if we had somebody else in president? Or do you think he is scared of Donald Trump?

[Yeonmi Park]
Yes, that's for sure. I mean, under Biden, they would refuse to pick up calls from the White House, actually. For a few months, they would not return the calls to Biden's call.

That's how much mocked America was by the North Korean regime. I don't think Kim Jong-un would dare to do that. With Trump, they don't do any long-range missile tests right now.

So they do fear Trump. But it doesn't mean we are solving the North Korean issue permanently. I mean, President Trump's strength does keep them in check temporarily.

But as soon as we get another Democratic president, they are going to start doing all that kind of terrorist act again.

[Nick Shirley]
So you see Trump, he just met with Xi Jinping. He's met with Putin so far. I don't know if he's met with Kim Jong-un so far in his second term or not.

[Yeonmi Park]
No, I don't think he's met.

[Nick Shirley]
Do you think it's a good thing that Trump's able to talk to people like Vladimir Putin and talk to Xi Jinping?

[Yeonmi Park]
Yeah, I mean...

[Nick Shirley]
Because between North Korea, China and Russia, they're all allies together.

[Yeonmi Park]
Yeah, of course. I mean, Kim Jong-un, China and Xi Jinping and Putin is like came up with a new pact, right?

[Nick Shirley]
Because if it wasn't for Russia paying North Korea for soldiers, North Korea wouldn't have as much money. And if China wasn't buying missiles or doing testing with North Korea, they wouldn't have any money. So those two countries fuel North Korea.

Without them, North Korea would be nothing.

[Yeonmi Park]
They would be nothing. They would not be existing right now. I mean, we still got to talk to this massive economic political power countries.

They all have nuclear weapons that can destroy the world. So how do we ever solve anything without talking to them? So I'm all for talking to them, but solving the real problems, yeah.

[Nick Shirley]
Do you think there's ever a day where North Korea is free? And do you think the people of North Korea would even accept it if somebody did come and try to free them?

[Yeonmi Park]
It's never been tried, but I do think there will because North Koreans are not led by strong jihadist ideology. A lot of Middle Eastern countries is a very homogeneous nation, and there's no internal conflict. There's no civil war going on inside North Korea.

So as long as we do move the current leadership and put on another leadership that's democratic, free society, I do think it's possible to change the country for sure. It's a lot easier to change than countries in the Middle East that have so many different factions going on internally.

[Nick Shirley]
Who's after Kim Jong-un?

[Yeonmi Park]
I mean, he has sons, he has a daughter, but it's not about who takes over next time because China is propping up this dictatorship. It's not without Chinese help. Kim Jong-un cannot be a ruler, right?

So it doesn't matter who's next. If China wants North Korea to be this way, it will be this way.

[Nick Shirley]
Now that you've escaped North Korea, you went to China. How did you get to America?

[Yeonmi Park]
I escaped through Gobi Desert to Mongolia to get out of China. And from Mongolia, I was sent to South Korea. After five years later, I came to America to study at Columbia University and write my first book.

[Nick Shirley]
And do you feel guilt at night when you're laying in bed? Do you feel like, why was I the one that made it out and made it to America?

[Yeonmi Park]
I did have that for a long time. And when I learned what the feeling of guilt was, I stopped feeling it. Because that's, I don't know if you're a Christian, but I am.

It's not a feeling that God wants us to feel. He wants us to feel gratitude. The guilt is not a sign of virtue.

It's not. So many people live in guilt, and I wanted to feel grateful. So in the beginning, I did have this survivor's guilt because I know exactly I'm not the brave one.

I just got lucky, right? So, but then now I feel immense gratitude for everything that happened to me and being in this position right now.

[Nick Shirley]
How often do you think about your times in North Korea as a kid? Because you were only there for 13 years. Now you're in your 30s.

How often, how prevalent are those memories to this day?

[Yeonmi Park]
I think it's also like getting out of North Korea took a while. So by the time I reached South Korea, I was like 16 years old. It does shape you.

There's no denying that how much my root is coming from North Korea. How I view the world, how I live my life, it's all come from that value that I had. But in some sense, when you are like me, who traveled to many countries and live in many different cultures, you get to accept the things that is good for you and let go of the things that was not helping you.

And there are things that I am grateful for that I was raised in North Korea because unlike America, in North Korea, there is human intimacy and connection because we don't have smartphones. We get to talk to our neighbors, we get to see our friends. And it is very sad being in America, how people are glued to their screens and start looking at each other's eyes.

[Nick Shirley]
How do people communicate nowadays? Are you able to talk with any of your family who are in North Korea?

[Yeonmi Park]
No, North Koreans can't have internet. Their phones cannot make international phone calls. It's a completely isolated country.

So there's no way you can reach us in North Korea.

[Nick Shirley]
And so when you hear people that talk about like hypothetically, what happens in North Korea, does anybody actually know other than people like you who've been in North Korea about what happens in North Korea?

[Yeonmi Park]
It's hard to know and government designed it that way. It's not only try to brainwash the North Korean people. They also try to brainwash the Westerners.

There are a lot of YouTubers travel to North Korea. I don't know if you know that. And the government let them come and do manipulate them.

They don't show actual North Korea, obviously not, right? They're going to set up this like a different place and then make them to believe that North Korea is not as bad. And it's more progressive country.

And they don't get to talk to actual North Korean people. When you go there, you are with your surveillance guides 24 seven. And remember the other one year, I don't know the Virginia Tech University students who went to Florida.

He was not supposed to go in his own hotel. There are floors that he was not able to go and he did. And that's how he got captured and then sent to prison camp, right?

[Nick Shirley]
There was an American who went and then took a poster and then...

[Yeonmi Park]
That's what they accuse him of, but nobody knows. Like it's not a video graphically. It's like, it's like that's what they accused.

So he supposedly went to the floor. The guy told him not to go to and then he was trying to grab the propaganda banner. But even if that was the case, you cannot put someone in prison camp for taking some propaganda banner on the wall, right?

[Nick Shirley]
Because those banners that you guys have, you guys don't have advertisements inside of your country. It's just propaganda, the Kims, right?

[Yeonmi Park]
Nothing allowed to compete with attention, like attention wise to the government. So there's no such a thing called the fans. You are not allowed to be a fan of sports or like some movie stars.

The only thing you are allowed to worship and love is a dictator and the communist party.

[Nick Shirley]
Man, the life in North Korea just sounds like a living hell for so many people.

[Yeonmi Park]
Yeah, and there are so many people who still want a communist country. And that's like what's amusing to me.

[Nick Shirley]
Yeah, because now you see it here, obviously with Zoran, we already talked about that. People just like every time I go to a protest or whatnot, you see people with the communist flag. And they're just like, oh, it just wasn't done right.

Or China is actually doing great. And China is a prosperous country. But I mean, what you're talking about as far as the people being, they're just allowing all this human trafficking to go on.

And you do see great innovation from China. But then there's also sounds like a very dark side of China that nobody ever gets to know.

[Yeonmi Park]
Yeah, people are not doing that well, especially right now. I mean, Chinese people are giving up hopes. It's a very economically, they're not doing that well.

I mean, they talk about inequality in capitalism. Have they been to China? How unequal the society is on the communist party.

The people literally can't find food. And there are people who are like so rich, right? Who own like private islands.

[Nick Shirley]
And how does one go up in society in North Korea specifically? How does somebody level up from being poor to middle class to rich? Is that possible?

[Yeonmi Park]
You cannot move up the class. You're born with it. So your ancestors determine your status in the society.

Like right now, the Marxists always say the white people are guilty for the slavery that happened because of their skin color, right? Like in North Korea, same thing. If your grandparents were landowners or capitalists, they say your blood is tainted.

Your genetics is oppressive. That's how you're going in the lower ranking of the caste. But if you had a grandparents who fought along with Kim Il-sung during the communist revolution, they say you have a revolutionary blood.

But nobody chooses their parents. So the society is nothing about meritocracy. It's nothing to do with your own character, what you are willing to do with your own life.

It's all about who was your ancestor. Just like in America, they want to do the victim, right? Who's oppressive, who's not?

It's based on your skin color. It's just exactly like that in North Korea.

[Nick Shirley]
So you would have had no chance of ever making it out of where you were currently at in life in North Korea?

[Yeonmi Park]
No, because I did have it on my mom's side. My great-grandfather was a landowner that I never got to meet him. But because of him, because of his sin, that we were all guilty.

Anybody born in that bloodline, that's how evil this Marxism is. It's never about individual. It's never about your character.

It's just all about what connection did you have? What ancestors did you have?

[Nick Shirley]
What do people do to make money in North Korea?

[Yeonmi Park]
Breaking the rules.

[Nick Shirley]
And if you break the rules, don't you die? Like you say the word black market. You've said that a few times.

How are they able to have these black markets if there's so much surveillance and so much little control from the people?

[Yeonmi Park]
So think about it. Why communism can never work? So suppose that the government is going to provide you housing and food and education, health care, everything.

But then government decide not to do that. They don't have money anymore because Soviet Union was helping the regime and the Soviet Union collapsed. The regime does not want to do that.

So now people have to go to the shop to the government-assigned jobs, but they don't get paid and they don't get fed. So then they have to be corrupt, right? Think about the doctors.

They have to perform surgeries and take care of patients for free because it's a free hospital. But then doctors, if they don't be corrupt, how are they going to feed themselves and their children? So even though it's a free hospital, doctors are not going to treat you for free.

They demand you bribe. If you don't give them bribe, doctors are not going to treat you. Let's think about the pharmacists who are supposed to give you free medicine, but then they also don't get paid by the government.

So unless they charge you for this medicine, they cannot feed themselves. So they are forced to be corrupt.

[Nick Shirley]
So communism just forces corruption.

[Yeonmi Park]
Everybody needs it. So the teachers too. Free education, I do go to school, but then if I don't bribe, bring the bribes to my school teacher, she doesn't get paid.

So she needs to hit me to either bring her the bribe or kick me out of the school. So now children can go to school, even though it's supposedly free, but then teacher doesn't get free, they get any food from the government.

[Nick Shirley]
And then what would happen if you were then to go and tell the government that your teacher was taking bribes?

[Yeonmi Park]
Well, then that officer who does not support the party, because he doesn't also get paid. So now he's not going to demand the teacher, you give me the bribes. Do you see?

And he's the type of guy who's in charge of him. He needs to demand the bribe. Everybody needs to be corrupt.

Otherwise, this communism doesn't work. How do you make everything free and then nobody gets paid?

[Nick Shirley]
Was there any sort of trust? Did you even trust your family? You didn't even trust your mom?

[Yeonmi Park]
No, nobody can trust anybody.

[Nick Shirley]
Did you trust your sister?

[Yeonmi Park]
No, you don't even trust yourself. I mean, that is the only way you can survive. Like the first thing my mom told me as a young girl was, don't even whisper.

She said the most dangerous thing I had in my body was my tongue. Because if I said the one wrong word, it was going to kill eight generations of my family's life. So nobody trusts anybody.

[Nick Shirley]
And you didn't know God existed at that time. Did you think there was a power that would read your mind? How did you know the difference between good and evil?

[Yeonmi Park]
There's no good and evil. There's no difference of that. You don't learn the good and evil.

So I did not know what God was.

[Nick Shirley]
And did you think anybody was reading your mind? Or listening to you? Yeah, the dictators would, yeah.

So you thought, was it Kim Jong-un?

[Yeonmi Park]
Kim Jong-il at the time.

[Nick Shirley]
Kim Jong-il? Did you think he could listen to your thoughts? Yeah.

[Yeonmi Park]
So I didn't even think.

[Nick Shirley]
So it got so bad to where you literally thought that an immortal being was listening to you.

[Yeonmi Park]
Yeah.

[Nick Shirley]
He had that power. And people today still believe that.

[Yeonmi Park]
Yeah. I do believe that.

[Nick Shirley]
When you say you weren't thinking about anything, how did you have the mental capacity to not think about anything? Was it because you were starving that you couldn't think about other things? Like, was there any sort of creativity that sprung from your mind when you were a child?

Did you play house with your friends? Did you guys play tic-tac-toe in the streets?

[Yeonmi Park]
I mean, we can't afford those materials. How do you come up with the tic-tac-toe materials? The fanciest thing would be using a rug and draw lines on the mud.

Maybe jumping in the little holes. Maybe that's what we do. Like, we don't have board games or toys.

There's no concept of toys.

[Nick Shirley]
Wow. And I feel really honored to be speaking with you today. A funny story.

My grandma, before she died, she listened to your book. And when you died, they're going through all these letters and whatnot. And they're finding these letters.

And one of the letters was a letter to King Jong-un.

[Yeonmi Park]
Really?

[Nick Shirley]
My grandma had written a letter saying, you have such wonderful people. You have such beautiful people. And God must have loved you so much to bestow you this country.

But yet, so many people are dying. You have such a responsibility. You have such power.

God must have loved you so much to give you this responsibility. Why don't you listen to the people? My grandma wrote that letter to him.

She was with her purity. She thought she could get a letter to King Jong-un. But obviously, that wasn't possible.

But because of your books and what you told her through the audiobook or through the book she read, she was so compelled and inspired to try and send a letter to King Jong-un. Because he had such responsibility. Because there's so many innocent people like you who are just living in poverty that are dying.

And people's organs are coming out of their bodies on the streets of North Korea because of what the dictatorship's doing to the people. And so I think you've just been a very powerful voice for so many people. And you've been really impactful.

And God's obviously used you to tell the story of North Korea from a lens that most people will never see.

[Yeonmi Park]
Oh, thank you. It still amazes me how good people are. And usually, I think people are born with two capacities, right?

I don't think we are inherently good or bad. It's all about how the environment shapes us. Like in a society like North Korea or China where there's no God and the only thing you are allowed to worship is your party, people don't learn this goodness.

And people don't even learn the critical thinking. So you asked me, like, how did you not think? We don't learn how to think critically.

I remember going to South Korea, and the government was trying to, like, deep brainwash us, right? And saying, you're like leaders who are not God. They're dictators.

Look at them. Like, they stop people, and then themselves are so fat. And I did not know Kim's so fat.

Entire my life in North Korea, looking at him in the television or newspaper, I thought he was starving, like, exactly like us. Every day we had to sing this song, like, dear leader, please take a rest and eat properly because we keep hearing he doesn't sleep, works so hard, doesn't eat any food, and starving like us. And then I come to South Korea, someone literally had to teach me that he was fat because I was not able to think critically because I never ever practiced that.

And I didn't even have the word for that. So I did not know the concept of what's a critical thinking.

[Nick Shirley]
You couldn't even critically think by looking at him that he's well fed.

[Yeonmi Park]
No.

[Nick Shirley]
You had no idea.

[Yeonmi Park]
No.

[Nick Shirley]
The brainwashing is very real. What would be your last warning to people about socialism, about communism? Because people use the word socialism, communism.

They're pretty much the same words.

[Yeonmi Park]
Yeah.

[Nick Shirley]
Right? What would be your warning to people that are trying to accept socialism and communism ideas? Here inside the Western world.

[Yeonmi Park]
I think nowadays, like in the past, people are just looking at me, or like looking at North Koreans are just like a brainwashed robots who have no intelligence whatsoever. But when I came to the West, Colombia, these people have zero problem understanding that men can be a woman in any circumstances they want to. Right?

Like literally people in New York, they think there's no difference between men and women or based on how you feel. Right? And that to me, even more shocking than anything else.

So we are capable of being brainwashed, even in the age of open information, like in America. And that really shocked me. Why the left is so adamant that we need to believe in this?

Because if you do believe that men can be a woman, then you are going to also be able to believe that slavery is freedom. That's what they're going after. To erase all kinds of truth, erase our ability to think critically.

And that's why we're in the moment of now defending the truth. People like Charlie Kirk, they really, really do fear the truth. If they didn't fear what he said, they don't have to kill him.

Right? So this is so important for us to keep the truth, talking about the truth and defend the truth.

[Nick Shirley]
Yeah, because there's right and wrong in this world. And there's also pure truth.

[Yeonmi Park]
Yeah, there is a truth. There is an objective truth. And so many people, oh, it's just based on how you feel.

You're my own truth. I mean, that's so unbelievable. People have access to this many books and believe that.

That's what's shocking to me. At least North Koreans, they have access to zero books, zero information, zero online activity. And people here, they have everything and still yet believe some of this kind of brainwashing.

[Nick Shirley]
Brainwashing is very real.

[Yeonmi Park]
Yeah, it really is.

[Nick Shirley]
And here in the modern society of the United States, where like you said, there's books, you have social media. In North Korea, you don't have any of that. So you can't not become brainwashed if you only see one side of the world.

But here in the United States, you can see everything. But people are still becoming brainwashed to a lot of these ideologies, which is a good warning for everybody. And I just want to say thank you so much for coming on.

And I know my grandma would be happy to know that I spoke with you today because of the letter that she wrote because of your book. Thank you so much for coming on today.

[Yeonmi Park]
Thank you very much for having me.

[Nick Shirley]
Amazing. Thank you so much. That was awesome.
