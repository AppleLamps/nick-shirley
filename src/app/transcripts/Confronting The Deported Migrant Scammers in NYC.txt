[Nick Shirley]
On September 7th, while filming a video showing the illegal counterfeiting markets by illegal migrants in New York City on Canal Street, I attempted to ask how much they were selling a substance for on the street, and after being cussed out and my cameraman punched, we left the block and never came back. Well, it turns out this group of migrants were wanted by ICE and were targeted in a raid that erupted in the streets of New York City, and after the next day, the streets were completely clean of illegal activity, and I thought the chaos was over. However, I came back to New York City a few weeks later, and while walking through the area, the migrants noticed me, and all hell broke out.

[Speaker 10]
And while the scammers and I were going back and forth, a local who lives in the area came out.

[Nick Shirley]
And then all the scammers got mad at me for recording me. You don't have to record him. Just like you're recording him, just like you're recording him.

If you're going to record me, I can record you. Who's recording you? He was recording me.

[Speaker 6]
So what you're doing is okay, but what he's doing is not okay.

[Nick Shirley]
No. Is that what you're saying?

[Speaker 6]
No. That's what you're implying. Do you see me recording him?

[Speaker 12]
He's recording me.

[Speaker 6]
But him.

[Speaker 5]
But him. Then don't get mad at me. Huh?

Then don't get mad at me. I'm not mad at you, because you come here, you accuse us of selling counterfeit goods.

[Speaker 12]
Is that real?

[Speaker 6]
That's not real.

[Nick Shirley]
Counterfeit. So what? So what?

So what?

[Speaker 6]
Just like you guys can record us, he can record you guys. I'm not recording.

[Nick Shirley]
He's recording. You're getting mad at me for recording. Look at all these cameras.

One, two, three, four, five, six.

[Speaker 12]
Good work.

[Nick Shirley]
Good work. Show your face. See how they treat the police?

They don't even care about NYPD here on these streets. Meanwhile, they're getting mad at me. I was literally walking back to where I'm going for tonight, and I had to walk through Canal Street, and that happened.

Because they saw the video where obviously nine of their buddies got deported. How are you? See, now that he recognized me.

This is a dangerous street for me to be walking on here on Canal Street. That is no longer their block. I'm going to take it down from here to here first.

And as I prepare to go back to Canal Street and take back the street, I want to show you the big contrast between people that support the law and other people whose empathy does not allow them to support the law, just like this lady here.

[Speaker 7]
My husband showed me a clip of that kid Nick Shirley going around Canal Street antagonizing the men who are trying to just like, you know, sell us some shit there. Wow. And you guys think I need to get a life?

What a fucking loser. Shut up, bitch.

[Nick Shirley]
And as people want to turn a blind eye to this illegal activity and act like it's inhumane to have law and order on the streets, I wanted to see how these people would treat a woman if they saw her on her phone on Canal Street. So I sent out my mom onto Canal and said, act like you're on a FaceTime call and see what happens.

[Speaker 8]
What am I filming? I just want to buy some presents for my daughters. I don't know which one to get.

There's too much stuff here. Yeah, but ma'am, we'll probably be out here. Don't go there?

Yeah, I don't want you to get in trouble. You're going to get in trouble. I'm going to get in trouble?

Yeah, for that. Okay.

[Nick Shirley]
And after having proof that it was not safe for a woman to be walking on Canal Street with a camera, I headed there myself to confront the scammers and see what they would do if they saw me. But really quick. I've never done this before, but we're going to do a sponsor right now.

And the sponsor of this video is Opus Clip. Opus is more than just an AI clipper. They're actually the fastest AI growth tool for creators and businesses.

Over 10 million creators and businesses have started using them, and they've helped gain over 60 billion views. In fact, I actually had a buddy start using Opus Clip. He has just around 100 followers, and he's already had a video get above 30,000 views.

That's how good Opus Clip is. And recently, Opus just came out with their AI editor 3.0 that comes with smarter auto framing, better virality scoring, and new captions. And my favorite thing about Opus is how easy to make it to reformat your content for all different platforms, whether it's TikTok, Snapchat, Facebook, YouTube, you name it, you can use Opus Clip.

And right now, for you guys watching, they're going to hook you guys up with a sweet deal. You'll get one week free and three months at 50% off. All you have to do is use code NICKSHIRLEY and go to the pinned comment down below or the link in the description.

I promise you guys, Opus is a game changer. And now, let's get into the streets of Canao. Did you guys just buy some goods?

What did you guys get today? Or is this the seller right here? Oh, Louis Vuitton.

There's the dealer right there. There's one of the Asian dealers. So you have the Asian dealers right here.

They have all the stuff right here. They have the whole entire catalog right here. What are you going to buy today?

[Speaker 7]
No, not yet.

[Nick Shirley]
What's your favorite thing to buy here from Canao Street?

[Speaker 7]
I haven't been here in about two weeks.

[Nick Shirley]
Whoa, whoa, watch that. We don't do aggression here.

[Speaker 6]
Don't look at somebody, man. What's up? What's up, man?

[Nick Shirley]
What's up? How you doing? What's wrong with the camera?

What's wrong with the camera? We've got a camera to film whatever we want. All right, we've made it now to Canao Street.

We already got the people out. Now we got the Asians pissed off. And then right here you have the African sellers as well.

What's wrong? What's wrong? You're not going to yell us off this block.

[Speaker 2]
We're residents here. We are openly filming this.

[Nick Shirley]
No, man, no, no, no, no, no, no.

[Speaker 2]
We're filming. We're filming. This is open.

This is private.

[Nick Shirley]
All right, we have now made it here to Canao Street.

[Speaker 2]
Public property. Sweeney, you're a local here.

[Speaker 12]
Is this normal?

[Speaker 2]
This is local public property. You are entitled to film anywhere on public property. No one has a privacy right over anything.

[Nick Shirley]
What do you guys think about Canao Street and the scammers and now the counterfeit selling that's at rampant levels right now?

[Speaker 10]
Yeah, it's a lot more than there used to be here.

[Nick Shirley]
So it's a good amount. What are you doing? What are you doing?

Now we just got pushed out by one of the counterfeit sellers. Thank you, sir.

[Speaker 2]
Look at that. A resident just like that just getting pushed out by somebody. Aggressively pushed and shoved with his elbow.

[Nick Shirley]
Now this is the main Canao Street. We're just on the corner of Canao and Lafayette. Look it up.

Look it up. Look, they're all running right now. We ourselves, my presence, has cleared this whole entire block right now.

We got all these guys. I'm just walking through here and all these guys are clearing out because of my presence of the camera. Why do you think just my presence alone with the camera is scaring these guys off right now?

[Speaker 2]
If they're not breaking the law and there is no criminality, why are they bagging up their goods as soon as we walk with a camera, not starting anything, not being hostile, and fleeing the entire block? I can't stand folks, especially people from out of state, saying, oh, they're just peaceful, they're not breaking the law, they're not breaking any laws. If they are not breaking the law, why does a simple camera from one person clear out 40, 60-yard bojacks and f***ing dashes simply because you're coming out here and filming the street?

That is very clearly, evidently criminal activity.

[Nick Shirley]
So these guys all packed up, and now they're going to their next location. They still got the Rolexes out with the AirPods. But literally, just my presence with this camera cleared out the whole entire block right here.

Now they're just facing the wall. They don't want their faces to be seen right now. Look, these guys right here too.

Now they put their hands up. Don't want to be seen. And a camera's not criminal, right?

We can be filming here on these streets. I don't know if I can disclose this, but you're a lawyer. You're an attorney.

I'm an attorney.

[Speaker 2]
Can we be filming on these streets? This is public property. No one has a privacy right over any inch of this.

You guys can film me. I can film you. This is a sidewalk in New York City that hardworking, taxpaying residents contribute to.

[Nick Shirley]
Look, we cleared this whole entire block right here. Day by day. Overtaken.

This is the continuation of Canal. We're just one block into it from Lafayette. Now we're at Olmos Canal and Broadway.

But look at this. All of this stuff right here.

[Speaker 2]
There used to be one stretch that lasted like a single block. And it was peaceful. Mostly Asian-Americans selling goods.

They kept out of folks' way. They were happy. They were nice to people walking by.

Women with their strollers. Nowadays, I had someone send me a message that she was walking with her 9-year-old son and they offered him drugs right in her presence. Two days ago, I'm walking with two girls.

Someone said they'd slash my face simply for holding a camera. So there's another thing, too. Someone had mentioned ICE.

I've been living here for years. Other people have been living here for decades. Ask them.

ICE came here from one day. For one single day, 24 hours. This place looked like Pleasantville.

Women could walk peacefully with their dogs, with their children, having a coffee. ICE left. Zorn was elected.

Block by block has now spread and it is taking over entire zip codes. If ICE comes, they're gone.

[Nick Shirley]
What's worrying is the plain fact that this is no law and order is taking place here on Canal Street.

[Speaker 2]
There's a difference between hustling, right, and trying to make money, and then breaking the law, okay? Pimps, prostitution, things of that nature are law-breaking and are also hustles.

[Nick Shirley]
Entire block. We were around on the other block and now this is another block completely filled with this stuff. Look, you can get Louis Vuitton, Chanel, Gucci, everything.

And they're all obviously all counterfeit goods. And as soon as they see the camera, they're all ducking their face. Look, all the scammers have their faces down right now or they're facing the other way.

And now they're putting all this stuff away. And this open-air market of fake counterfeit goods goes on for blocks. We've been from Lafayette to Canal.

Now we're on Broadway and Canal. Now we're going over to the other side. And look, it goes not even down all the way, more down Broadway.

You have more blocks. This is the biggest counterfeit open-air market, scam market, whatever you want to call it, in America. And look, now these guys are filming us.

What they're going to do is they're going to film us, put us in their WhatsApp group chat. You guys saw, as soon as I pulled up on the block, they freaked out because they obviously knew who I am because my video potentially led to some deportation. The Canal Street vendors are on both sides of the street, from that side to that side, and then all the way down there as well.

They're everywhere here. And look, they just litter the streets. And they saw the cameras, so they moved off this block.

And it just keeps going down and down. A lot of people are just going to start leaving New York City if law and order does not help. They're paying it up in taxes.

[Speaker 2]
New York City is one of the highest taxed cities known to planet Earth right now. It has city, state, and federal taxes. And so there's already begun a mass exodus of folks who are sick of this sh** because they're getting no bang for buck out of their dollar of taxes.

So they're moving to Florida, where it has a lesser tax burden and has the enforcement of law and order. How does that help our tax bases for different projects that Zoran wants to do? How much?

[Nick Shirley]
No price? Free today? Everything free?

He won't give me a price. Is it free today? No price.

How much are the bags today? How much? They won't even answer me.

Maybe I should start grabbing for free. How are you? How much for bag?

Bro's acting like he's in the Feddy fold right now. He's not trying to give me a price. What are we buying out here on the canal?

[Speaker 6]
I bought me a little Louie bag.

[Nick Shirley]
They're clearing out right now. They're clearing out. They're clearing out.

Just my presence alone here on the street is clearing out the block right now. They're yelling all sorts of stuff in French. How much?

How much? Wallet, how much? No one will give me a quote with the camera.

And how much are you making out here?

[Speaker 8]
Like $700.

[Nick Shirley]
Really? So he's making $700 a day out here? So these sellers are making lots of money.

$700 a day? And keep in mind, that is all tax-free. A tax-abiding citizen, if they're making $700 a day, they're going to be giving anywhere between $20 to $40, potentially even 50%, depending where you're at here in the United States, backing to the hands of the government.

These guys keep it all for profit. You got to respect the hustle, but also, it's illegal. They have all of the Rolexes.

Oh. Why can't I film? No film?

I was just showing the product.

[Speaker 12]
He can film whatever he wants.

[Speaker 2]
This is a free society.

[Speaker 12]
Hey, hey, hey.

[Speaker 2]
Hey, hey, hey, hey. We can film here on the streets. This is a public property.

This is public property. See how hostile they get? Public property.

Just filming. We're not aggressive. We're not hostile.

That's the energy you get. Now imagine being a woman walking through here with your camera on. You want to take some pictures as a tourist.

[Nick Shirley]
And people might say, well, what happens to all the other women? My mom literally came down here. Acted like she was on a FaceTime call showing my sister what kind of products they had.

And they said she was going to be in trouble for walking on these streets and filming. And right here on this block is where the deportations took place of nine illegal migrants that were selling goods here on the street. And they were arrested.

And it was a targeted arrest. And the man had been charged and convicted prior for assault, recklessly endangering, counterfeiting third degree, unauthorized use of a motor vehicle, criminal sale of narcotics, possession of a controlled substance, possession of marijuana for sale, making false reports to law enforcement, and resisting arrest. So all these people here are not perfect law-abiding citizens here in the United States.

And the deportations that took place were because of crimes like that. And right now, it looks like we have the police coming through right now. Let's see what happens.

All right, they're already freaking out on us right now. We can film.

[Speaker 2]
No, no, no, no. No? We can film wherever we want to film at.

It's America.

[Nick Shirley]
This is the place where Isaiah got the punch and was jumped. How do you feel to see what's going on here and now everything's back up? It's a shame.

It's a real shame.

[Speaker 9]
There's really no words. No words.

[Nick Shirley]
And to see this place where you were once jumped, just to come back with all the people right back here, does that make you feel like you're being protected here in New York City?

[Speaker 9]
No, absolutely not. It does rile the nerves a little bit, being out here. You know, we're not being confrontational.

We're not being aggressive to anyone. We're trying to ask questions, if anything. But people will always be sensitive.

What?

[Speaker 5]
People are nice here.

[Speaker 9]
No.

[Speaker 5]
Only one time is good. This is a nice guy? We're legal here.

[Nick Shirley]
You're legal?

[Speaker 5]
Right now, the people here are illegal. I'm from here.

[Nick Shirley]
We're not checking documentation. The deportations that took place here were for some of the people out here on this block. Exactly.

What did you think about the deportations that happened?

[Speaker 5]
You can deport criminal people, you know. But here, I think the black guy here, a lot of people, they're illegal people, you know. They don't do crime.

They sell on the street, bags, that shit. So are you... If they don't need to fire you today, you'll be fine.

[Nick Shirley]
Yeah. And what do you guys think about ICE? They work.

They have to work. So you're in support of ICE coming through here?

[Speaker 5]
I support it. They take criminal people, you know. And you're not...

Big time respect. But don't put it to me, take it to Nicky. He love you.

He's saying he likes me. I'm sorry for last time my boy fighting, you know.

[Nick Shirley]
And what did you think about when my cameraman got jumped here on this corner?

[Speaker 5]
I think you finally do your work. I like what you did.

[Nick Shirley]
Thank you. And so you support that deportation?

[Speaker 5]
I support everything you do. It's your country. You have to do for everyone.

Just sorry to disrespect you last time, my boy. You know what I mean? And Nicky, we love you.

And did he get deported? I don't know. I think they are jailed.

I don't know.

[Nick Shirley]
You haven't heard anything back from him?

[Speaker 5]
That's my people. I know them only here. They are married white girls.

[Nick Shirley]
So over the past few days, I've been acquiring some goods from these counterfeit dealers to go set up my own shop on Canal and see what they do to see whose block it really is. If I get chased off the block, then it is therefore their block. But if they get ran off the block, it's the block of American citizens.

It's your block. Now it's time to go reclaim and take back the block. We're going to go set up shop and see what happens here on Canal Street.

Alright, setting up shop. You guys are leaving? Wait, why?

We're selling too. They're leaving. You guys want some?

We're giving stuff away for free. Free. Free stuff from Canal.

We just cleared one corner. We're going to go see what happens on this next corner.

[Speaker 2]
The block is hot. If they want to come up and take block by block of selling illegal content, what is stopping an American citizen and a tax-paying resident from coming in here and setting up shop ourselves?

[Nick Shirley]
We got our own right here. We're setting up shop. I ain't starting no trouble.

I'm working on this block just like you. I'm working on the block just like you. I'm on the same block as you guys.

[Speaker 6]
We're setting up shop too.

[Nick Shirley]
You want some stuff?

[Speaker 6]
What are you doing?

[Nick Shirley]
He says he's got something for me. Can we set up shop right here? Why not?

You guys want some free stuff? Alright, so today we're out here selling on Canal. You can pick whatever you want.

It's free today. See, now they're moving. Why can't we set up shop?

But you guys can. I ain't playing either. Alright, they're gone too.

Let's see if we can set up shop right here. We got a whole shop right here. Let's see what happens if I set up shop on their block.

Can I sell right here? Can I sell right here?

[Speaker 6]
I got my block.

[Nick Shirley]
See, look at that. Why can't I sell here? Why can't I sell here?

I'm not dumb, bro.

[Speaker 2]
I'm not dumb. I don't care.

[Speaker 6]
Look, we're clearing the block.

[Nick Shirley]
We have just cleared the block right here. I ain't doing nothing. I'm not here.

I'm not hostile. We're seeing what happens if we bring our stuff here. We're seeing what happens if we bring our stuff here.

We're on the street.

[Speaker 6]
Then you better move.

[Nick Shirley]
Then you better move. Look, we just cleared the whole block.

[Speaker 6]
The block's gone.

[Nick Shirley]
Hey, not my Louie. Come on. Alright, so we just cleared two blocks at this point now.

The scammers are gone out of this block. Alright. Let's pick up.

Let's pick up and let's move all around. We're moving. We just cleared that block.

That block is now clean and clear. So now we got this guy coming after us. He's the one following us.

He's saying, get off. Get off. We're moving.

We just cleared that block.

[Speaker 6]
I'm on your ass for a day. Then be on my ass. You're fucking up my block right now.

So go ahead, bro. It's not your block.

[Nick Shirley]
We just moved out of the whole block. What if I wanted to give you a Gucci bag? Would you take it?

I got some free ones right here. I'm giving stuff away for free, sir. You want a Gucci bag or no?

You don't want it?

[Speaker 6]
It's for free today. It's for free today.

[Nick Shirley]
Get up out of here. Get up out of here. How are you doing, sir?

[Speaker 6]
How's your day going?

[Nick Shirley]
Nice to meet you, sir. Get the fuck up out of here, bro. We ain't trying to have no problem.

[Speaker 6]
Get up out of here. Get the fuck up out of here. People can film on the street.

Get out of here, nigga. People can film here on the street. You still got to keep it moving out of here.

We ain't bothering nobody. We're not. I don't want to do that.

[Nick Shirley]
Every time you come out here, it's a problem, bro. We got the police right here. Show the police.

We got the police right here. What do you think? This guy's telling me I got to get off this block.

[Speaker 6]
You can stay here the same way you can stay here.

[Nick Shirley]
Mind your business. It's none of my business. Get the fuck out of here, man.

[Speaker 6]
If he could be here, you could be here. Get the fuck up out of here. Get the fuck up out of here.

Every time you come out here, it's a problem, bro.

[Nick Shirley]
You're the one starting the problem. Who started following me? You're the one who started following me.

[Speaker 6]
Stop playing with me, man.

[Nick Shirley]
You're the one who started following me.

[Speaker 6]
Every time you come out here, it's a problem, bro.

[Nick Shirley]
I ain't starting a problem. And I want to make a point. I'm not angry at these people.

I don't have anything against any of these individuals, per se. But the thing is that law and order is not being upheld here in the streets as far as the counterfeit goods selling. It's just a gateway to other things.

He's even gotten personal messages from mothers who've had people as young as nine years old been offered drugs. So by not holding these people up to the crime such as just counterfeit selling, it's just a gateway into other things happening here inside New York City.

[Speaker 2]
100 percent. And we're not going to get a press force of city blocks that belong to every New York City resident regardless of the race, gender, ethnicity. What do you mean?

If you want to talk to me, I'll have a conversation with you.

[Nick Shirley]
You keep yapping at us over here.

[Speaker 2]
We're not trying to do nothing.

[Speaker 4]
How?

[Nick Shirley]
What do you think about the counterfeit selling? I don't give a shit.

[Speaker 4]
People are trying to make a living.

[Nick Shirley]
So you don't care that law and order is not being upheld?

[Speaker 4]
What is law and order?

[Nick Shirley]
Law and order. That's a great question. What do you think law and order is?

[Speaker 4]
I'm asking you, though. What do you think that is?

[Nick Shirley]
The laws of the land being upheld here in the United States.

[Speaker 4]
What kind of laws?

[Nick Shirley]
Every single law.

[Speaker 4]
So the law to kidnap people for making a living?

[Nick Shirley]
If they came into the country illegally and ICE finds out that they're illegal, they have the right to deport them. It's not a human right to be here in the United States. It's a privilege.

[Speaker 4]
Interesting. So how do you feel about your privilege being born into this?

[Nick Shirley]
Yeah, I'm very lucky.

[Speaker 4]
Yeah, so how about your ancestors who came here and stole land from indigenous people? How do we feel about that?

[Nick Shirley]
There's actually a conquered war, and then they bought it.

[Speaker 4]
ICE is kidnapping people?

[Nick Shirley]
Kidnapping to find kidnapping.

[Speaker 4]
They're taking them off their street. They haven't done anything wrong. They came here to make a living because their countries are unlivable because of the U.S. imperialism that is happening in their country, stealing their resources, their land, their gas, their way of living. What do you think you're doing here?

[Speaker 2]
What do you mean?

[Speaker 4]
What are you doing here?

[Speaker 2]
I want to address that piecemeal, right? You said they're kidnapping folks.

[Speaker 4]
Yes, they're taking them.

[Speaker 2]
If they are here illegally.

[Speaker 4]
Are they here illegally, though?

[Nick Shirley]
You don't even know that. These guys cross the border. Ask any of them.

[Speaker 4]
Who cares about the f***ing border? You guys cross the border all the time traveling. Legally.

[Speaker 2]
With a visa, legally.

[Speaker 4]
Legally. Again, the definition...

[Speaker 2]
There's not a quotation. You asked me what law and order is. Legally is not a quotation that we throw around and put on Hallmark cards.

[Speaker 4]
Legally is a quotation because somebody needs the law. Somebody gets to define the law and it's never the people who get affected by that law.

[Speaker 2]
That's a complete lie. We live in a democracy.

[Speaker 4]
We do not live in a democracy.

[Speaker 2]
What do we live in?

[Speaker 4]
Trump is in a fascist American machine.

[Speaker 2]
Trump won the both popular and electoral vote.

[Speaker 4]
That is the definition. He did not win the popular vote. He won both by a majority.

The electoral...

[Speaker 2]
You won the popular and the electoral.

[Speaker 4]
A reporter of the country votes for him and half the country doesn't vote. Is that a democracy? What do you think a democracy is?

[Speaker 2]
Every person that had the opportunity to vote, that was not taken away from them, voted for Trump.

[Nick Shirley]
What do you think about the counterfeit deal and stuff that happens here on Canal Street?

[Speaker 3]
I don't like it. I like the clear sidewalks. It's my neighborhood.

[Nick Shirley]
So, yeah. People are like, this is a good tourist destination. They can come here.

They can buy the fake Gucci and whatnot. But the citizens that pay New York City taxes and care for their city and have to come through here every single day, what's it like for you?

[Speaker 3]
Yeah, it's annoying. I never use the Canal Street station. So, it's like a whole major station that I generally avoid.

And yeah, it's like a lot of tourists also coming in, crowding the streets, buying stuff and making there be an incentive, a demand for my neighborhood to be worse. So, yeah. I don't know exactly the situation of the people selling.

I think in some situations they're paying off human smugglers that got them over here in the first place. So, essentially, we're making slave masters richer because the money just goes back to whoever's in control of their life. I'm not exactly sure what their circumstances are though.

That's something I heard about like door dashers and stuff.

[Nick Shirley]
So, it's super sad because a lot of these people, they're able, capable people from Africa. The majority of them are. They crossed the border illegally.

They came here. They didn't get any documentation. They couldn't get their working visas.

So, now they're out here selling stuff illegally. So, it also highlights the fact that our immigration process here is messed up and that the effects of what happens when you do have open immigration. But the fact that law and order is not being upheld here in the streets and people like you can't even use the subway station because you don't feel safe coming down here is just the point of this.

We're not going after these people.

[Speaker 3]
It's more annoying than unsafe. I don't feel like I'm physically under any violent threat, but it's annoying. I watch kids and when we're walking on the sidewalk, I say we share the sidewalk.

If there's an abuse of the commons and we can't share it anymore because people are diminishing its value because they don't feel a sense of ownership over it, then it's just not going to work. New York relies on social harmony more than any other place in the U.S. So, yeah, that's important.

[Speaker 11]
If you're going to be honest about what's going on, it's a legal activity and that's the truth.

We have successfully cleared out a few blocks here in Canal Street just with our presence putting on our bags. We weren't selling. We were giving away for free.

And this is Sweeney right here. If you guys want to follow him, it's on Instagram. I'll leave his at in the description.

And if you guys want to see part one of this video, that was the finale. We're never coming back. So that part one is right here.

Actually, if this video gets 100,000 likes, we'll do a live stream here on Canal Street.
